Instead of using commercial activated carbon, researchers have worked on inexpensive materials, such as chitosan, zeolites, and other adsorbents, which have high adsorption capacity and are locally available. The results of their removal performance are compared to that of activated carbon and are presented in this study. It is evident from our literature survey of about 100 papers that low-cost adsorbents have demonstrated outstanding removal capabilities for certain metal ions as compared to activated carbon. Adsorbents that stand out for high adsorption capacities are chitosan (815, 273, 250 mg/g of Hg2+, Cr6+, and Cd2+, respectively), zeolites (175 and 137 mg/g of Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively), waste slurry (1030, 560, 540 mg/g of Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cr6+, respectively …",2003/2/28,Low-cost adsorbents for heavy metals uptake from contaminated water: a review

6,"Sandhya Babel, Satoshi Takizawa",169,"This study was carried out to investigate the membrane fouling phenomena due to algal deposition and to understand the nature of the cake deposited on the membrane while treating the algae-laden water by membrane filtration. To accomplish this, batch experiments in dead end mode were carried out using Chlorella algae to investigate the effect of feed concentration and transmembrane pressure (TMP) on cake resistance using cellulose ester and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. It was found that algae can cause significant fouling of both the cellulose ester and PVDF membranes. Fouling due to algae is quite complex because these cells release extracellular organic matter (EOM) which significantly increases the resistance.

14,"S Babel, TA Kurniawan",68,"Contamination of groundwater due to toxic heavy metals, such as As and Hg, is of international concern. In this paper, the technical feasibility of some technologies to treat metalcontaminated groundwater is reviewed. All data presented are quoted from the original sources. It is conclusively evident from the literature survey that low cost technology, like adsorption, can demonstrate excellent metal removal capabilities comparable to reverse osmosis. Due to chemical modification, adsorption using inexpensive materials, such as coconut husk carbon, can remove As (III) with metal adsorption capacity of 159 mg/g. This high adsorption capacity suggests that adsorption treatment technique is capable of reducing a residual arsenic concentration to 10 µg/l, which is the maximum discharge limit set by the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). In spite of the availability of various technologies to treat metal-contaminated groundwater, the suitability of a selected technology for such a purpose depends on the initial metal concentration, the residual metal concentration required, the removal performance on heavy metal compared to other technologies, and the overall treatment cost.",2005/12/1,Various treatment technologies to remove arsenic and mercury from contaminated groundwater: an overview

By doping with Sr, a Sr-rich shell was formed over a Sr-poor core. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy revealed the simultaneous occupation of the K sites and Ta sites by Sr cations. A concentration gradient of Sr cations occupying the Ta sites was suggested to be produced after doping with Sr. The concentration gradient of Sr cations simultaneously induced an energy gradient of the conduction band edge bottom. Hence, photoexcited electrons are separated, which are driven away to the bulk by the energy gradient, from the complementary holes present on the surface. The higher the Sr cation concentration, the higher the energy gradient produced.

The effect of reaction temperature on the yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is studied. Conventional transesterification is also performed for comparison. FAME production is also carried out with new cooking oil (NCO). The results show that a reaction temperature of 80 C is optimum for FAME production in the presence of either KOH/CS or CaO-ES. The produced biodiesel properties satisfy the criteria according to ASTM D6751. Acid catalysed esterification of WCO before transesterification leads to higher production of FAMEs due to the reduction of free fatty acids (FFAs). However, conventional transesterification using WCO without esterification yields lower FAMEs. Although the microwave heating decreases the reaction time, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in FAMEs. The production of FAMEs depends on not only the type of transesterification process, but also the type of feedstock.

The result shows that PS NPs remained substantially stable in low ionic strength (NaCl: 1-200 mM or CaCl2: 0.1-5 mM), whereas significant aggregation occurred in high ionic strength (NaCl: 400 mM or CaCl2: 10 mM). In addition, under the same ionic strength conditions, the particles remained more stable in Na2SO4 solution rather than in NaCl. The addition of natural organic matter had no significant effect on the aggregation of PS NPs at 150 mM NaCl, 0.1-1 mM CaCl2, or 1/3-50/3 mM Na2SO4. The aggregation of PS NPs was boosted at 5 mM CaCl2, while it was inhibited at 200 mM NaCl or 200/3-400/3 mM Na2SO4.

When confirmed the result with SEM-EDX analysis, two samples were found to have silver on the surface of fibers. The diameter is approximately around 5.0 µm (500 nm), which is larger than the nanosize (1-100 nm). In three samples, titanium was found on fibers and surface of the samples and also found in eight ash samples. The leaching results from nano-Ag fabrics with deionized water were found in range of 146 to 229 µg/L. Type of liquid coming in contact with materials containing nanosilver, may have impact on amount of nanosilver leached and this should be investigated further.

An alteration in canal’s geography due to the development of industrial estate coupled with the pollutant discharges by upstream community has hindered the use of canal water for the downstream community who depends on the canal most. This research project is carried out to mobilize stakeholder’s participation on environmental issues of Bang Pa canal. It involves capacity building of the community in water quality conservation through water quality monitoring and biological assessment using macroinvertebrates. For this, 60 volunteers from four sub-districts were actively involved. The integrated results of water quality and macroinvertebrates analysis show that the upstream water quality of the Bang-Pa canal is better as depicted by physico-chemical and biological parameters (water quality index). As the canal passes through the community, the quality deteriorates as the polluted water flows into the canal through alternative paths. The activities of the project have been integrated with the ongoing environmental efforts of the villagers on the conservation of the canal to maximize the effect. The involvement of local administration was rated as satisfactory by the community towards the issues of the canal.

The granular CSBAC was made up of coconut shell, an abundantly available agricultural waste from the local coconut industry in Thailand. Chemical treatments of CSBAC and zeolite with HNO3 and NaCl, respectively, were also conducted to improve their removal capabilities. The results of their removal performances on Cr were evaluated and statistically compared. It was conclusively evident that the chemically treated adsorbents (CSBAC and zeolite) demonstrated significantly better removal capabilities for Cr6+(CSBAC: 15.47, zeolite: 3.23 mg/g) than asreceived adsorbents (CSBAC: 4.72, zeolite: 1.79 mg/g), respectively.

We undertook a standardised case-control study in 22 countries worldwide between March 1, 2007, and April 23, 2010. Cases were patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days of symptoms onset and 72 h of hospital admission). Controls had no history of stroke, and were matched with cases for age and sex. All participants completed a structured questionnaire and a physical examination, and most provided blood and urine samples.

Recurrent stroke is a frequent, disabling event after ischemic stroke. This study compared the efficacy and safety of two antiplatelet regimens — aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (ASA–ERDP) versus clopidogrel.
Methods
In this double-blind, 2-by-2 factorial trial, we randomly assigned patients to receive 25 mg of aspirin plus 200 mg of extended-release dipyridamole twice daily or to receive 75 mg of clopidogrel daily. The primary outcome was first recurrence of stroke. The secondary outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from vascular causes.

Prolonged lowering of blood pressure after a stroke reduces the risk of recurrent stroke. In addition, inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system in high-risk patients reduces the rate of subsequent cardiovascular events, including stroke.

223,Sombat Muengtaweepongsa,5,"Objective: To study risk factors of stroke in Pathumthani. Material and Method: Pathumthani comprises of seven districts. One sub-district was selected from each district. The subject group was those aged 30 years or older. Staffs of Sub-District Health Promotion Hospitals were trained to assist in the data gathering based on questionnaires on blood sugar and lipid levels. The staffs conduct cross-sectional analyses of the information.
Results: Of 714 subjects, most were female (66.9%). The average age was 56 years (SD 10.7). Forty-six point two percent had their body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or more. Fifty-six point four percent had larger waist circumference than average. Sixty point eight percent had their cholesterol levels over 200 mg/dl while 14.9% had their blood sugar levels of 126 mg/dl or higher. Seven subjects (1.0%) had stroke. As for the risk factors, 32.4% had hypertension; 16.9% had hyperlipidemia; 13.1% had diabetes mellitus; 8.9% smoked and 2.0% had heart diseases. Forty-eight point seven percent had at least one risk factor, among these, 55.2%, 29.9%, 12.0%, 2.9% and 0.0% had one, two, three, four and five factors, respectively. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of stroke in Pathumthani was one in 100 people aged 30 years or older. The observed important risk factor of stroke was hypertension.

245,Sombat Muengtaweepongsa,2,"Evoked potentials are the electrical signals generated by the nervous system in response to sensory stimuli. Auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli are used commonly for clinical evoked potential studies. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) consist of a series of waves that reflect sequential activation of neural structures along the somatosensory pathways. While SEPs can be elicited by mechanical stimulation, clinical studies use electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, which gives larger and more robust responses.
The stimulation sites typically used for clinical diagnostic SEP studies are the median nerve at the wrist, the common peroneal nerve at the knee, and the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle. SEPs can also be recorded following stimulation of branches of the trigeminal nerve, but this is technically challenging because of the proximity of the stimulating and recording electrodes and the short latencies of the responses; the electrical stimulus artifact often overlaps with, and obscures, the trigeminal nerve SEPs. Recordings of SEPs to stimulation of the ulnar nerves at the wrists are useful for intraoperative monitoring when the mid-cervical spinal cord or parts of the brachial plexus are at risk.

Pulse transit time (PTT) was recorded by Lead II and finger pulse wave. Stenotic flow velocity and intima/media thickness (IMT) ratio were measured by Doppler ultrasound.
Results: Profound lower NO is found in all groups. Highest level of H2O2is evident in LQTc and differs significantly from those in SQTc and NQTc. Greater
HR, blood pressure, pulse pressure and reduced pulse transit time were found in LQTc. Insignificant difference of stenotic flow velocity and IMT ratio was demonstrated in all QTc groups. In LQTc, greater LF/HF ratio and SD2/SD1 suggest predominant sympathetic drive over parasympathetic activity. Greater scatter gram of Poincare’plot corresponding with low value of sample entropy in LQTc indicate well organized complexity of autonomic modulation.

In this study, the authors demonstrated the improvement of inflammatory biomarkers after hypothermia treatment in both animal cerebral infarct models and patients with ischemic stroke. Inflammation is an important step in the ischemic cascade. Therapeutic hypothermia, newly substituted by targeted temperature management (TTM), shows promising effects against the ischemic cascade via multiple mechanisms. In addition to the neuroprotective effects of TTM, their anti-inflammatory mechanism is most essential. TTM has become a standard treatment for cerebral ischemic damage due to cardiac arrest.

Due to a limitation of resources in Thailand, echocardiography is done in only some patients with acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the need for cardiac investigations, especially TTE, in Thai patients with acute ischemic stroke.
Material and Method: Two-hundred and seven patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), who had TTE results during August 2006 to November 2008, were studied. Patients were divided into 2 groups by the risk of cardioembolism: low-versus high-risk groups. All echocardiography results were reviewed and classified by the need for management change following the echocardiography.
Results: Abnormal TTE results indicating a need for change in management were found in 4%(4/102) and 18%(18/105) in low-and high-risk patients, respectively. The results of ECG alone led to change in management in 17%(36 patients). Atrial fibrillation was the most common cause of cardioembolism, which was found in 35 patients (17%). Conclusion: Because of limited resources in Thailand, ECG should be routinely performed on all ischemic stroke patients and TTE in patients with high risk for cardioembolism.

Olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by prominent cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Those who study OPCA quickly learn that it is not a single entity, and that its nosology can be confusing. The umbrella term of OPCA includes common sporadic forms and uncommon genetic forms. In the genetic subgroup, all 3 major inheritance patterns (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked) have been described. The classification scheme for autosomal dominant OPCA overlaps with that of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar atrophies (SCAs) and autosomal dominant cerebellar atrophies (ADCAs). In the sporadic type of OPCA, at least some of the cases are a subset of multiple system atrophy (MSA).
While the classification is seemingly convoluted, there is good reasoning behind the complexity. The study of neurodegenerative ataxias draws from the interplay between clinical observations, neuropathological analysis, and biochemistry and molecular genetics. Historically, however, one had to rely solely on the combination of clinical observation and neuropathology to describe the disorders.

Changes of plasma NO and sLOX-1 were studied within the first 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours after the onset in 65 acute ischemic stroke patients and 18 control subjects. We investigated the influence of hemodynamics through stenotic flow velocity by carotid duplex; non-significant stenosis flow (NSSF) and significant stenosis flow (SSF). Patients were divided into two groups, large vessel atherosclerotic occlusion (NSSF: n= 48, SSF: n= 6) and lacunar infarction (NSSF: n= 11). Blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing tubes and promptly centrifuged samples at 4 o C for 15 minutes at 3000 g. Plasma was immediately frozen at-70 C until analysis. Plasma NO concentration was measured by electrochemistry technique and sLOX-1 was assayed by ELISA.
Results. In patients with large vessel atherosclerosis, plasma NO level was significantly reduced in NSSF (55.01±1.00 nM/L) when compared with those control (77.12±1.64 nM/L). Remarkably reduced plasma NO was showed in SSF (47.53±1.72 nM/L). sLOX-1 was increased significantly in SSF (2.07±0.03 ng/ml) compared with control (0.78±0.03 ng/ml) whereas NSSF was 1.10±0.02 ng/ml. In lacunar infarction group, plasma NO was slightly reduced (57.47±0.58 nM/L) whereas sLOX-1 was still low (0.89±0.03 ng/ml) and showed dramatic difference when compared with those atherosclerotic occlusion group.

325,"A Jantanukul, S Muengtaweepongsa, K Suwanprasert", ,"Background: Cardiac arrest is a cause of death from systemic through global brain injuries. Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended as a guideline for cardiac arrest treatment in order to reduce injury. Until now, many studies have reported controversial data concerning predictors of survival outcome. In this study, we investigate neuronal-glia interaction associated with neurovascular NO marker during therapeutic hypothermia. Methods: 11 participants aged 52.09±4.72 were studied. Plasma samples were collected at an initial time (t= 0) and during mild hypothermia for 12-18 hrs (t 12 and t 18). Nitric oxide was measured by electrochemistry technique. Plasma S-100B and NSE were assayed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay.
Results: NSE levels were gradually decreased at t 0, 12 and 18 hrs (111+ 46.48, 76.92+ 14.53 and 69.84+ 16.48 µM, respectively). S-100B levels were also suddenly decreased from 485.2+ 212 to 142.5+ 53.39 and 176.2+ 39.67 nM, respectively. Significant positive correlation between glia-neuron markers was r= 0.37 (p< 0.05). Nitric oxide level was reduced (57.06+ 3.89, 51.06+ 4.85 and 54.29+ 3.82 nM, respectively) and it was significantly correlated with S-100B level (r= 0.38, p< 0.05)
Conclusions: Neuronal-glia interaction associated with neurovascular NO may play a novel role in neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia.",Blood,Neuronal-Glia Interaction and Neurovascular Coupling during Mild Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest

However, the benefit of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) added to a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed in the early phase of the event to identify this etiology is not well established.
Objective: To determine the potential role of TEE in acute ischemic stroke. Methods: All patients with acute ischemic stroke and sinus rhythm underwent complete physical examination and TTE to exclude any obvious cardiovascular etiology of stroke. TEE with an agitated saline injection test was then performed within 48 hours after admission. All standard views were obtained. Echocardiographic data were analyzed off-line by two independent cardiologists.
Results: Eighty-eight patients were finally enrolled. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease including diabetes was common. In addition to TTE, TEE was able to demonstrate numbers of left atrium (LA) spontaneous echo contrast (SEC), patent foramen ovale and plaque in the ascending aorta. Left atrium appendage (LAA) emptying velocity was low (< 50 cm/sec) in 13 patients (15%). An association between SEC and LAA emptying velocity was demonstrated.

If there exists a real number k∈[0, 1) such that for all x, y∈ X, the following inequality holds: d (fx, fy)≤ kd (x, y),(3.1) then f has a unique fixed point in X. This famous result is called the Banach contraction mapping principle named for Polish mathematician Stefan Banach in 1922 (see [10]), and is one of the most important theorems in the field of fixed point theory. Due to its strong applications in proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions of integral equations, people have looked more closely at it for many years. Notice that the contractive condition (3.1) is satisfied for all x, y∈ X, which forces the mapping f to be continuous, and so the principle is not applicable where f is discontinuous. By virtue of this drawback, it is sometimes inconvenient to use this principle. Recently, several authors attempted to overcome this difficulty, see, eg, Ran and Reurings [50], Kirk et al.[35], Jachymski [27] and Samet et al.[58].

In this paper, we propose a novel tortuosity index based on principal component analysis. The index is compared with three existant indices using simulated curves and real retinal images to demonstrate that it is a valid indicator of tortuosity. The proposed index satisfies all the tortuosity properties such as invariance to translation, rotation and scaling and also the modulation properties. It is capable of differentiating the tortuosity of structures that visually appear to be different in tortuosity and shapes. The proposed index can automatically classify the image as tortuous or non tortuous. For an optimal set of training parameters, the prediction accuracy is as high as 82.94% and 86.6% on 45 retinal images at segment level and image level, respectively. The test results are verified against the judgement of two expert Ophthalmologists.

However, these techniques are computationally expensive and should therefore be performed at a reasonable rate. This paper presents an algorithm for discarding irrelevant feature points and maintaining them for future use so as to improve computational cost. The algorithm starts with examining the maintained feature points. Corner detection is required only when the feature points are insufficient. Then, optical flows are computed toward the new frames for only the maintained points. Further, the simplified affine motion model is developed by linear regression with some outliers presented. Studentized residuals are used to eliminate outliers that belong to moving objects. The modeling and elimination processes repeat until no more outliers are identified. Finally, the entire algorithm repeats along the video sequence together with the points remaining from the previous iteration. As a practical application, an efficient video stabilization can be achieved by exploiting the computed motion models. Our study shows that feature points can be maintained for certain sequence of frames, thus having fewer optical flow computations. The number of times corner detection needs to be performed is also greatly reduced, thus significantly improving the computational cost.

While some success has been achieved in human-computer interaction applications, hand tracking would also be extremely useful in security systems, where it could help the system to understand and predict human actions, intentions, and goals. We have designed and implemented a prototype hand tracking system, which is able to track the hands of moving humans in low resolution video sequences. Our system uses grayscale appearance and skin color information to classify image subwindows as either containing or not containing a human hand. The prototype's performance is quite promising, detecting nearly all visible hands in a test sequence with a relatively low error rate.

Our main result is that two problems in this class which we call the chosen-target and known-target inversion problems, have polynomially-equivalent computational complexity. This leads to a proof of security for Chaum’s scheme in the random oracle model based on the assumed hardness of either of these problems.",2001/2/19,The power of RSA inversion oracles and the security of Chaum’s RSA-based blind signature scheme

Embedding stegosystems are stegosystems that do the concealment by embedding a hiddentext message into a given covertext to generate a normal-looking stegotext. Many practical embedding stegosystems have been proposed to embed hiddentext in various media such as images, video, audio, and text documents in multiple languages. There have been some recent attempts to formalize steganographic security notions and to construct stegosystems that are provably secure under those notions. In these models, covertness is defined as either statistical or computational indistinguishability between covertexts and stegotexts. However, thus far, none of the analyzed systems are embedding stegosystems—all of the schemes based on these notions assume either precise knowledge of the covertext distribution or the existence of a black box sampling oracle capable of drawing random samples from the true covertext distribution. These schemes are thus impractical or irrelevant in scenarios where the covertext distribution is unknown, under control of the sender, or too complex to sample from efficiently. These scenarios include many of the media thus far proposed for practical embedding stegosystems, including natural images, video clips, voice conversations, and text documents.

699,Chanathip Namprempre,3,"Digital communication has become prevalent over the last few decades. The increasing popularity of the Internet and the proliferation of wireless networks have allowed people to conduct business and to communicate “online.” Naturally, as the popularity of the medium increases, so do the concerns. Businesses and individuals alike are demanding security guarantees from the applications and services that they use. The most basic of these requirements are privacy and authenticity of data in transmission.
Cryptography is a field that addresses these concerns. In classical cryptography, the process of designing cryptographic constructs bears a striking resemblance to a typical software development cycle which generally proceeds as follows. First, the specifications and requirements for the software in question are determined. Second, the software is designed and developed according to specification. At this point, it may go through a quality assurance process for additional testing and maintenance before it is released. Once released, the software generally goes through revisions possibly of both specifications (users may request additional features) and implementation (bugs may be discovered), and the cycle repeats. The design of cryptographic constructs in classical cryptography proceeds in very much the same manner. The designer determines possible threats and security concerns that the construct is to address and designs the construct accordingly.

Most authentication systems prevent a malicious subject masquerading as a trusted subject by relying on some secret shared by the subject and the authentication system. If the secret is leaked, or if the authentication system is bypassed, then the authenticated subject may be malicious. Real-time intrusion detection can be used as second line of defense behind the authentication system. An intrusion detection system monitors system information for suspicious activity. Such activity might be a set of commands known to be contained in a script used to attack a system, a sequence of failed attempts to start a telnet connection on a set of machines (both examples of misuse detection), an unusual set of shell commands or a sequence of unexpected system calls (both examples of anomalous behavior detection). The intrusion detection system might generate a general report indicating that suspicious activity has been noticed or it might identify a speci c subject as behaving in a suspicious manner.
In our research, we model subject-speci c real-time intrusion detection as a kind of failure detector, where the failure is analogous to an arbitrary failure. Failure detectors are useful because they allow one to use classic methods of fault-tolerance in which the system is brought to a safe state when a failure is detected.

It also allows one to\glue"" together heterogeneous systems into a single application by wrapping each individual system with a distributed object. These reasons, along with the benet of having an open client-server architecture, have made distributed object middleware very popular. Using a distributed object architecture, however, also introduces some new problems. One problem has to do with latency. An object may nd itself unable to make progress without speci c knowledge about the state of other objects. In the CORBA model, to learn about the state of other objects, an object invokes a method on them. When the two communicating objects are located at di erent physical locations, these method invocations are implemented using messages. The latency introduced by communication may become a bottleneck of the system. This bottleneck becomes more pronounced as the objects are distributed over a wide-area network, and will grow over time as processor speed generally increases at a higher rate than the network speed. A common method for ameliorating the impact of such latency is through optimism. With optimism, an object (or more generally, a process) assumes that the states of other objects satis es some property. The object then continues execution under this assumption while in parallel it checks the validity of the assumption.

–
Innovation and the process of diffusion have been widely acknowledged as hinging upon the complex social psychological process. Invariably, such a process manifests itself in the form of “climate” in an organisation, which influences people's behaviours. The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the roles of a facet‐specific climate, namely “climate for innovation” in determining innovation‐related outcomes. In particular, this paper focuses on interrelationships and roles of specific constructs forming such climate. Additionally, this paper attempts to determine the efficacy of innovation by examining the relationship between outcomes of innovation diffusion and business performance.

To achieve the research aims, the Palm Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) reaction tests were used to measure the reaction time of a sample of concrete crew members at different times during the day onsite over a one-week period. By measuring the reaction times of workers, the relevant levels of fatigue were determined. Productivity was measured using the Labour Utilisation Factor (LUF) by observing productive, supportive and non-productive times of the sampled crew onsite. The results from the tests showed that fatigue was present in sampled workers. The highest levels of fatigue were found to be due to high temperatures and physical exhaustion. The results showed that as fatigue increased among workers, the productivity dropped.

In some countries, the rate of total workplace injuries from construction activities can be as high as at least 50%. This is undoubtedly a serious matter warranting urgent attention. In the past decade, interest in the nature of ‘safety climate’and its role in predicting occupational accidents and injuries has increased. However, research findings regarding the relationships between safety climate and other key outcomes constructs such as safety behaviours and safety outcomes are to some extent inconsistent. Recent safety climate literature suggests that examining the role of safety motivation may help provide a better explanation on such relationships. In view of this, the authors of this paper have developed a conceptual model depicting the relationships between three main constructs: Safety Motivation, Safety Climate, and Safety Behaviour. In particular, the model hypothesises that Safety Climate has a mediating role on the relationship between Safety Motivation and Safety Behaviour. The aim of the research study presented in this paper was to empirically assess the proposed conceptual model within the context of Saudi Construction Industry. To achieve this, a questionnaire was developed through a critical review of literature and was pilot tested with a number of safety management experts.

The IPSM approach was formulated considering the advantages and disadvantages of existing SD modelling approaches, as well as balancing the competing goals of SD model development efficiency and robustness. A key feature of the IPSM approach is that stakeholders are central to each of the five stages of the modelling process from problem scoping, to scenario analysis and strategy implementation recommendations. Each stage of the IPSM approach was demonstrated through a case study of the innovation diffusion process in the Russian Federation construction industry. This highly complex innovation system could only be sufficiently understood using a SD model that was conceptualised, critiqued, codified, tested and utilised, by the relevant actors within that system (ie, stakeholders). The IPSM approach facilitated the efficient formulation of the SD model for the case study application.

Historical condition ratings obtained from biennial bridge inspections are major resources for predicting future bridge deteriorations via BMSs. However, available historical condition ratings are very limited in all bridge agencies. This constitutes the major barrier for obtaining reliable future structural performances. To alleviate this problem, the Backward Prediction Model (BPM) technique for generating the missing historical condition ratings has been developed, and its reliability has been verified using existing condition ratings available from the Maryland Department of Transportation, USA. The function of the BPM is to establish the correlations between the known condition ratings and non-bridge factors including climate, traffic volumes and population growth. Such correlations can then be used to obtain the bridge condition ratings of the missing years. Based on these generated datasets, the current bridge deterioration model can predict future bridge conditions. The existing 4 National Bridge Inventory (NBI) and 9 BPM-generated historical condition ratings were used as input data to compare the prediction accuracy using deterministic bridge deterioration models.

918,"Kriengsak Panuwatwanich, Rodney Stewart, Sherif Mohamed",1,"Innovation is widely recognised as a driving force for a firm’s economic growth (Gann 2003). Particularly in the design sector where creativity and innovation dictate business competitiveness, firms capable of successfully generating and/or adopting innovation are more likely to stay competitive than those who do not. To achieve this, firms need to be able to understand how innovation can be effectively diffused. Diffusion, as defined by Rogers (1983), is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. As a result, innovation diffusion has been viewed as a result of a social psychological process.
Generally, social psychological process can manifest itself in the form of an environmental stimulus namely ‘climate’, which is considered as a determinant of motivation and behaviour (Kozlowski and Doherty 1989). Climate is defined as ‘a shared and enduring molar perception of the psychologically important aspects of the work environment’(Ashfort 1985). Furthermore, as pointed out by Schneider and Reichers (1983), members of an organisation are exposed to numerous events and situations which are perceived in related sets. Therefore, when examining climate in an organisation, it is imperative that climate be related to a specific issue. In view of this, the study presented in this paper concentrates on analysing ‘climate for innovation’.

Working at heights often magnifies these risk factors. The literature reveals that falls from heights accounts for a large percentage of injuries in construction worldwide. Thailand is no exception, where fall accidents constitute the majority of high-rise construction accidents despite preventive measures being implemented. This paper examines how the use of a simple Ambient Intelligence (AmI) system—a device comprising a microcontroller, microwave sensors, Light Emitting Diode (LED) and audio alarm—could help to affect safety behavioural change of on-site construction workers in order to decrease the potential for fall accidents. An experiment was conducted at a high-rise building construction site in Bangkok, Thailand to examine the effectiveness of the AmI in helping workers mitigate the risk of falling from heights. The analysis of the data collected over two work weeks from the pre-and post-AmI application using X-bar charts and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant reduction of about 78% in the number of workers passing through the fall hazard zones.

By understanding how energy is consumed, designers can significantly reduce environmental impact by selecting materials with low embodied energy and carbon emission intensity. Previous research showed that indirect emission could be higher than direct emission for energy-intensive materials such as cement and reinforcement steel. It is argued that quantifying direct emission alone could underestimate the total amount of energy and carbon emission and subsequently its impact to the environment.

the need to integrate environmental management into supply chains has been recognized recently. Yet, there is a lack of theoretical grounding and a conceptual framework guiding such efforts to leverage resources and capabilities across supply chain partners. Grounded on stakeholder and resource orchestration theories, this paper maps the emerging practices, develops a theoretical framework, and proposes future research for understanding an emerging best-practice called ‘green supply chain integration’ (GSCI).
Design/methodology/approach:
A systematic literature review of 142 academic articles is conducted to ensure the process of framework development is auditable and repeatable. The article selection criteria are aligned with the review question ensuring that related theories and practices are identified and evaluated.
Findings:
The paper illustrates how stakeholder and resource orchestration theories can be used to explain an integrative approach of environmental management in supply chains. The paper identifies four GSCI practices: internal, supplier, customer, and community stakeholder GSCI. A theoretical framework and proposition also provide new research directions.

This means internal integration was able to moderate the relationships between external integration and product quality and production cost.
Practical implications–The paper provides further insights into the roles of internal integration and external integration and their interactions for managers to reflect on.

995,"T Sattayaraksa, F Swierczek, S Boon-itt",1,"Introduction/Purpose–Customer orientation is considered as an important strategic direction that many companies adopt for product innovation because of the requirement to identify, analyze, and understand the current and future customer needs (Yang et al., 2012). Customer involvement for new products matches the customer orientation strategy. Firms paying more attention to customers will extensively commit to improve product innovation, which results in new higher product values, and overall firm performance (Heidt and Scott, 2011).
Resource dependency theory (RDT) emphasizes the influence of critical factors on organizational performance. Firms can respond to reduce environmental uncertainty and dependence even though they are constrained by their environments (Hillman et al., 2009). According to RDT, information on customer needs and experiences are valuable resources that companies depend on for new product success (Carbonell et al., 2009). Witell et al.(2011) found that co-creation process could lead to more innovative ideas than traditional marketing research such as an in-depth interview and a focus group. Lau et al.(2010)’s study also revealed that product codevelopment with customers directly improved product performance. Empirical results aforementioned support the positive impact of customer involvement or customer co-creation on new product development (NPD).

In particular, it tests the widely held view that the region's inflationary surge during 2007–2008 was primarily the result of external price factors such as oil and food shocks. Our central empirical result is that, contrary to popular misconception, Asia's inflation is largely homegrown and has arisen due to excess aggregate demand and inflationary expectations, rather than external price shocks.

The objective of this paper is to examine empirically the extent of the pass‐through of global food and oil prices to domestic consumer prices in nine countries in the region. The main empirical result is that the magnitude of the pass‐through has been limited.

The key finding is that MNCs tend to be more export-oriented than indigenous firms and the entry of the former stimulates the latter to become involved in the production of exports, i.e., the presence of MNCs export spillovers. However, the impact of MNCs on export activity/spillovers is not automatic, but depends on the trade policy regime.

The trade channel is crucial in transmitting economic distress from the OECD countries to developing Asia. The projection shows that developing Asia will continue to suffer from demand decline in OECD countries, with the PRC and India being the most impacted.

Controls on capital inflows introduced in the first half of 1994 helped moderate accumulation of short-term capital flows, particularly short-term bank credit.

The determinants of capital flows are then further examined. Portfolio investment and bank loans (both inflows and outflows) are more prone to the financial crises than foreign direct investment. The determinant analysis shows that economic prospects ofG3 countries are crucial in affecting movements of portfolio investment and bank loans. It is, therefore, not surprising that the recent global economic slowdown from the G3 markets resulted in the significant pullbacks of short-term capital. However, strong economic fundamentals, especially financial institutions, in the region help most of developing Asia to successfully redress and manage most of the adverse effects.

While our main finding is in favor of a liberal trade policy environment, we argue input and output tariffs should be treated separately in examining their impact on productivity. Ceteris paribus, lowering input tariffs potentially has at least two opposite effects. It allows firms to benefit in several ways, enhancing their productivity, while also discouraging their efforts to improve productivity due to the increased level of effective protection. This necessitates caution when pursuing trade policy reform in not placing too much focus on input tariffs while leaving output tariffs untouched. Even though input and output tariffs work differently in promoting firms’ productivity, any trade policy reform process should take both input and output tariffs into consideration in ensuring that trade is actually liberalized.",2017/6,Trade Protection and Firm Productivity: Evidence from T hai Manufacturing

The paper’s novel feature is that R&D investment is sub-divided into three broad categories, ie R&D leading to improved production technology to product development, and to process innovation. In addition, three key globalization forces, namely MNEs, exporting, and global production networks, are examined in a single framework over and above industry and firm-specific factors. Our key finding is that the determinants of each type of R&D are far from identical, suggesting that it is necessary to distinguish between the types of R&D when examining their determinants. The statistical significance of firm-specific factors found in our research suggests that the decision to carry out R&D largely depends on the firm’s profitability, and is therefore unlikely to be stimulated by policyinduced incentives. The role of government in this regard should emphasize the availability of infrastructure services and their adequacy for all types of R&D activities. Globalization through exporting and FDI can play a role in encouraging firms to commit to R&D investment. The latter has an indirect effect in encouraging locally-owned firms to engage in R&D investment whereas the former has a direct effect on R&D leading to product development. Another highlighted finding is that participating in a global production network could encourage firms to be even more active in all types of R&D activity.

This issue is even more pronounced in the economic landscape in East Asia, and Indochina in particular, as income disparities in the region are considerable, and the scope for regional cooperation to achieve potentially mutual benefits from international migration is substantial. Thailand and its Indochina neighbours share long common borders. Any attempt to prevent cross-border movement is unlikely to be fully effective and could result in corruption and human trafficking. On one hand, some countries in the region have only recently started to integrate into the global economy. They still have an abundance of labour and low wage rates.

In labour-intensive industries and industries with intermediate levels of trade protection, the impact of trade protection on firm productivity was negative and significant. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) had higher productivity than indigenous private firms (IPFs), with productivity usually being the highest in joint ventures (JVs). Wholly-owned foreign MNEs (WOs) also had significantly higher productivity than IPFs in 2005–7, but these productivity differentials appear to have become insignificant in 2008–10. In capital-intensive industries, JVs had the highest productivity, but were followed by WOs, then SOEs and IPFs in the earlier period.

Three proxies of advanced technologies are used in the study: (i) information and communications technology, (ii) intensity of robot use, and (iii) value of e-commerce. Our study compares the effects of technological advancements on labour market outcomes with import penetration, delineating into raw materials, capital goods, and final products. Our results show that in Thailand, the impact of advanced technology in pushing workers out of the job market is limited. Instead, it tends to affect reallocation of workers between skilled and unskilled positions. The results vary amongst proxies of technology and sectors. It seems that workers in comparatively capital-intensive industries, including automotive, plastics and chemicals, and electronics and machinery, are the most affected by advanced technology. Dampened wage/income is found only in some proxies of technology and sectors. Our results show less concern of negative impacts induced by imports, particularly imports of capital goods and raw materials, on employment status and income than technological advancement.",2020/8/15,"Technological Advancement, Import Penetration, and Labour Markets: Evidence from Thai Manufacturing"

In this context, it’sa commitment to deploy 40GW of GC-RSPV by 2022 in the residential sector is facing multiple challenges, which is hindering the progress of market penetration on a large scale. The existing business models failed to deploy at scale due to limited support from loss-making discoms, lack of coordination between institutions, perception of residential consumers about GC-RSPV technology and access to consumer finance, etc made target unachievable. Hence, there is a need for a suitable business model, which is complemented a top-down approach with bottom-up initiatives along with the involvement of various stakeholders. Therefore, this study proposes a SHGs model to accelerate GC-RSPV at scale. This model is a viable strategy since it is mainstreamed in the financial landscape and this program is the world's largest social mobilization initiative supported by various stakeholders such as NGOs, governments, and banks. This model will yield good results if the discussed assumptions are fulfilled.

The problem is largely entitled to financial risks along with technology risk, policy risk, and regulatory risk, but do not disclose climate-related financial risk which has compounded the problem further. The objective of this study is to asses investors’ perceived risk while investing renewable energy projects and disclosure of such risks. Does climate risks are included and disclosed to financial institutions while investing to make project bankable and credible. Though several mechanisms developed over a time to mitigate financial and non-financial risks, the achievement is far below expectations. It is also found that there is a limited literature available on disclosure of climate-related financial risks and its mitigation measures in this sector. As a result, business and organizations in this sector are exposed to climate risks; its prolonged effect can generate systemic risk that can hinder economic growth. Therefore, this study proposes a climate risk assessment tool to disclose climate-related financial risks information along the supply chain of the project with other identified risks for investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders. Thereby, financial markets are in a better position to respond and manage climate-related risks.

Worldwide, the number of FTAs involving reciprocal tariff reductions jumped from 124 in 1994 to 625 by February 2016, nearly 70 percent of which are currently in force. 1 FTAs are expected to proliferate further. The newly launched agreements tend to be over and above existing FTAs with the hope of consolidating and overcoming the problems of the existing agreements. A clear example here is the ongoing negotiation of an FTA among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members–japan, the Republic of Korea (hereafter, Korea), China, India, Australia and New Zealand–known as the Regional Economic Comprehensive Partnership (RCEP).
Nonetheless, the extent to which the signed FTAs are utilised and firms’ perceptions of the business opportunities that emerge from these FTAs are important for designing these new agreements. The expected effect on trade induced by a signed FTA is conditional on various factors, such as the complexity of the rules of origin (RoOs)(criteria to prove product originality) that are imposed and implemented, tariff margins, and pre-trading volumes. The tradeenhancing effect of FTAs, therefore, varies across products but also across FTAs (Figure 6.1).

Ten emerging Asian economies are used as case studies to assess the effectiveness of capital account policy during 2000–2015. The results suggest that some types of capital controls are effective in reducing the volume of capital flows and pressure on real exchange rates. The choice of exchange rate regime matters in terms of the effectiveness of capital controls for fostering monetary policy independence. Although some types of capital controls are effective in creating macroeconomic stability, implementing capital account policy needs to be undertaken with caution. This is because substitution or complementarity among capital controls is evident, both within and across countries in the region.

Trade policy and global participation are treated as two different variables in our analysis. Controlling for firms’ global participation, which is defined as export-sale ratio and the extent to which raw materials are imported, our study finds that trade liberalization could induce firms to commit to activities that improve productivity. The effective rate of protection, where output and input tariffs are taken into consideration together, matters in improving firm productivity. Thus, it would be risky to continue tariff reform by focusing solely on a reduction in input tariffs while leaving output tariffs untouched.

Our key finding is that while firm-specific variables such as years of operation, R&D activities, a number of skill workers employed have positive effect on productivity, modes in which firms are integrated into the global economy like market orientation and foreign partnership positively attribute to their productivity. Firms operating in more restrictive trade policy register lower productivity than those in more liberal environment. The negative effect much higher for large firms perhaps due to presence of water-in-tariff occurring among small and medium firms. Different types of production network might have different effect. It is producer-driven network that have positive effect on productivity only the small firm sample. When firm size exceeds 110 and 125 workers, the effect on productivity is not different from zero.

The consumer’s self-concept or identity seems to be the"" Rome to which all discussions of modern Western consumption lead since the consumer is thirsting for identity and using commodities to quench this thirst""(Gabriel and Lang, 1995). The search for self-identity is a key determinant of postmodern consumption, so studying the consumer’s concept of self and its relations to symbolic consumption is essential for marketers seeking to understand the essence of postmodern consumer behaviour.
Recently much literature suggests that in the postmodern era the consumer should be perceived as an individual who, in a cultural context, is meaning-centred, and central to this approach is the recognition that the consumer does not make consumption choices solely from products’ utilities but from also from their symbolic meanings (Belk, 1988; Bourdieu, 1994; Dittmar, 1992; Douglas, 1982; Gabriel and Lang, 1995; Giddens, 1991; Goffman, 1959; McCracken, 1988). The functions of the symbolic meanings of products operate in two directions, outward in constructing the social world: Social-Symbolism, and inward towards constructing our self-identity: Self-Symbolism (Elliott, 1997). As consumption is central to the creation and maintenance of the consumer’s personal and social world, so advertising is recognised as one of the major sources of the symbolic meanings and values conveyed by consumption (McCracken, 1987; Mick and Buhl, 1992).",1998,Consumption and the Symbolic Project of the Self

In some societies, the notions of these social classes may be more apparent than others, and people appear to associate themselves with a particular class as their principal identities.

In postmodernity, where society becomes more global but simultaneously decentred, pastiche-like and hyperreal, the self is encountering a number of dilemmas propelled by the looming threat of personal meaninglessness. In order to attain a sense of existence, the self appears to seek the meaningfulness of life from and through symbolic consumption. Indeed, postmodernity is primarily a consumer culture where consumption is central to the meaningful practice of our everyday life. The postmodern self makes consumption choices not only from the products' utilities but also from their symbolic meanings, the function of which operates in two directions: outward in constructing the social world, social-symbolism; and inward in constructing our self-identity, self-symbolism.

We argue that the “time as resource” concept does not apply when prevention-focused consumers process non-alignable information. In this challenging decision situation, having more time to decide is unfavorable to CPS. A 2x2x2 between-subject experiment was conducted with 1,061 respondents to investigate the effect of NCC on CPS. The eight different scenarios (Table 2 refers) vary in consumer regulatory focus, information alignability, and time availability. The focus is on the role of time availability affecting the relationship between NCC and CPS. Regression analysis was conducted on each of the eight scenarios. The results show that the relationship between NCC and CPS is only significant when prevention-focused consumers process non-alignable information. The findings support the argument that the “time as resource” concept does not always apply. In these situations, NCC positively (negatively) affects CPS when time is limited (abundant). This paper challenges the long-held “time as resource” belief, and argues that having time abundance in challenging decision situations is unfavorable to CPS. Managers, especially retailers, can apply the findings to design decision-making environments such as providing time limits for complex choice decisions. This research is without limitation.

1129,"Alisara Charinsarn, Kritsadarat Wattanasuwan", ,"Advertisers and Retailers have always wanted to know the black box of how consumer is choosing a brand, and whether they are satisfied with the process. In this research, we study consumer choice set with a focus on the type of information, referring to alignable (comparable) and nonalignable (noncomparable) assortment. We propose that regulatory focus and time pressure moderate the relationship of alignability on consumer choice satisfaction. We are looking at these moderating variables in two steps. First, we are looking at the interaction effect between alignability and regulatory focus. Based on the prior literature that alignable assortment tends to lead to consumer choice satisfaction compared to nonalignable assortment (Zhang and Fitzsimons 1999). We further hypothesize that this is true for prevention focus consumers who are likely to use ‘avoidance’approach. However, we hypothesize that for promotion focus consumers, they will be satisfied with processing nonalignable information because they tend to use ‘advancement’approach. Second, we are looking at the ‘need for cognitive closure’, operationalized as ‘time pressure’as a moderator between alignability and regulatory focus on consumer choice satisfaction. We hypothesize that even among promotion focus consumers whom we expect to be satisfied with the choice process while processing nonalignable information, they would be less satisfied if they are under time pressure because time pressure would increase the need for cognitive closure (Webster and Kruglanski 1994).",2012,Who Is Your Customer and How Much Time They Have: the Moderating Effect of Assortment Type on Consumer Choice Satisfaction

Why some shy people become talkative when they are with close friends and family? If this is the case, these personality traits such as being introvert or extrovert are not intrinsic, sustainable, over time, and across different situations like what the traditional personality trait theory stated. How could this be possible? The situation affects how people behave (Belk 1975). The big five personality can be variant across situations (Fennis et al. 2005). People can have multiple self-concepts across time (Kelly and Rodriguez 2006). The Interactional Personality model (Lewin 1935) believes that the personality or the behavior we can observe is a result of the interaction between the person him/herself and the situation. This is in line with what Wattanasuwan and Elliott (1999) explain that the life history of a person and the social situation together form a meaning of a person’s experience (Wattanasuwan and Elliott 1999). Zayas et al.(2002) mentioned that “human behaviors commonly attributed to the individual are inseparable from the context in which they occur: Some behaviors may not be meaningful or even observable without placing individuals within contexts, particularly those that involve interpersonal relations”(Zayas et al. 2002)(p. 852).",2011,When Would Extroversion in Me Come Out?: Personality Paradox in Different Contexts

We try to re-organise and unify our saturated self into the narrative self (Giddens 1991; McAdams 1997). We make an effort to coordinate the multiple and conflicting facets of our lives within a narrative framework which connects past, present, and an anticipated future and confers upon our lives a sense of sameness and continuity (McAdams 1988). Ricoeur (1984; 1992) also supports that we require a narrative identity for our self, that is, we make sense of ourselves and our lives by the stories we can (or cannot) tell. Presumably, we come to know ourselves by the narratives we construct to situate ourselves temporally and spatially. Coyle (1992) elaborates that a person creates a life story, a biography or a personal narrative in an attempt to impart meaning and coherence to his/her disparate life experiences by forging connections, imposing causality, and making it appear as if his/her life has unfolded or is unfolding in a purposeful way. The life stories we create are not only a way of telling others or ourselves about our lives but also the means by which our identities are fashioned (Rosenwald and Ochberg 1992). We may not only tell the chronicle of who we are (or have been) but also an imagination of what we wish to become (or to have become).

The drastically increasing share of fossil fuel supply to meet the rapidly growing electricity demand resulting in increasing Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, is the major concern in Thailand. In 2015, fossil fuels used in electricity generation in Thailand accounted for around 85.3% of the total electricity generation.
Aim:
The aim of the study is to analyze carbon dioxide mitigation options under the cleaner supply-side option beyond the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of Thailand.
Methods:
In this study, the Long-range Energy Planning (LEAP) model is used to analyze the share of electricity generation and CO 2 mitigation from four main different scenarios, namely Business-as-Usual (BAU), Renewable Energy (RE), Carbon Capture Storage (CCS), and Carbon Tax (CT) scenarios during 2015 to 2050. The BAU scenario is constructed following the power development targets of the Power Development Plan in 2015.
Results:
The results illustrate that in the BAU scenario, electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector will increase by 57.7% and 37.3%, respectively in 2050 as compared to 2015. The imposition of carbon tax of $20/tCO 2 from 2020 and an increase to $500/t CO 2 by 2050 will have a high potential to reduce CO 2 emissions from the power sector as compared with other scenarios.

Thailand’s mitigation pledge under NAMA framework was successfully designed and communicated to UNFCCC in COP20. The integrated assessment modelling analysis plays an important role in the development of Thailand NAMA. Consensus building was derived from several discussions among stakeholders of NAMA implementation. Criteria for selection of greenhouse gas countermeasures were based on cost optimization by using a module of the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model called ‘AIM/Enduse’, abatement costs, co-benefits and feasibility of implementation. In addition, economic feasibility of countermeasures in NAMA actions was also assessed. Then, NAMA implementation has been prepared based on assumptions concerning limitations of resources, capital requirement, timing and appropriateness for Thailand.
Since 2012 Thailand’s mitigation pledge to UNFCCC has been prepared on the basis of domestic appropriate measures. Co-benefits of NAMAs are also assessed, and they reveal positive aspects of GHG mitigation under NAMA framework.

Results illustrate that in the BAU scenario, electricity generation and CO 2 emissions from the power sector would be increased by almost 16 and 42 times respectively in 2050 when compared to 2015. Results also show with CO 2 emission reduction potential of about 32.94% in 2050. The imposition of carbon tax amounting to USD500/tCO 2 has the highest CO 2 emission reduction potential in the power sector when compared with other scenarios. Results depict that except the RE scenarios considering lower shares of solar and biomass, all scenarios would help in attainting the 27% CO 2 emission reduction target of Cambodia’s INDC by 2030.",2020/3,CO2 Mitigation in the Power Sector in Cambodia: Analysis of Cleaner Supply-side Options beyond INDC

The objective of this study to assess the effects of Low Carbon Society (LCS) on the Thai and Sri Lankan power systems, in terms of CO2 mitigation, and energy security and other techno-economic results, such as marginal abatement costs. This study models the power sectors using a bottom-up optimization model called AIM/Enduse. The crux of the analyses is carried out using scenarios. Along with the LCS scenario, this study also considers a LCS scenario without the availability of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and has two separate scenarios with emission taxes of 50 USD/t-CO2 and 100 USD/t-CO2 on the power generation. Results show that there is a cumulative mitigation of 1.4 Gt-CO2 in the LCS scenario during 2010–2050, when compared to the BAU case for Thailand. Also, the effectiveness of the LCS scenario without CCS, known as the LCS/CCS scenario, is considerably reduced in the Thai power sector. The LCS scenario also has higher energy security, and better economic benefits. The LCS scenario in the Sri Lankan (SL) power sector has a cumulative mitigation of 166 Mt-CO2. The reduction in effectiveness of the LCS/CCS scenario in SL is not as drastic as the Thai power sector. The need of CCS for Sri Lanka is much reduced. The Marginal Abatement Costs (MAC) show that CCS technology plays a vital part in the Thai power sector and helps reduce the average abatement cost. This holds true in the case of the Sri Lankan power sector as well, yet not to the extent of the Thai case.© 2017 …",2017,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments

Nevertheless, the increasing diesel price and the higher cost of diesel transport to a long distance to the remote islands make the diesel-based systems unsustainable. This study analyzes the viability to increase solar photovoltaic (PV) resources in the existing diesel-based systems. The hybrid PV/diesel system is not only reducing the cost of electricity generation but also decreasing the harmful emissions from fossil fuels. This study uses net present cost (NPC) to evaluate the optimum PV/diesel system configurations for installation in isolated island in Thailand. The results of analyses show that the optimal case PV/diesel system can decrease COE from $0.429/kWh to $0.374/kWh when compared to the existing diesel-based system and can decrease emissions both carbon dioxide of 796.61 tons/yr and other gases of 21.47 tons/yr. The hybrid PV/diesel system also reduces diesel fuel consumption of 302,510 liters per year as a result from an optimal of 41% PV resource shares in this system.© 2016 The Authors.

This study explores socio-economic benefits of two pathways in which NAMAs can be realized in Thailand’s residential sector. Scenarios in the first pathway, called NAMA, are subjected only to CO2 emission constraints, and in the second pathway, called NAMAe, are subjected to both CO2 emission and energy demand constraints. In each pathway, there are three scenarios with low (L), median (M) and high (H) CO2 reduction targets. The AIM/Enduse, which is a cost optimization model, is chosen to carry out the analyses of CO2 mitigation, energy demand and average abatement cost (AAC), which are the economic benefits. The social benefits of each scenario are judged using a mathematical expression to predict the future Human Development Index (HDI) score that would result from the mitigation in each scenario. Results show that more efficient technologies are adopted in the NAMAe scenarios causing their energy demands to be lower than the NAMA scenarios by about 1%; however, there is no difference in the amount of CO2 reduction between the two pathways. The NAMAe-M scenario shows the highest amount of energy demand reduction of 10.4% in 2020 when compared to the BAU scenario. Among the energy efficient scenarios, NAMAe-L is predicted to result in the highest HDI scores of 0.687 in 2020.",2016/6/17,Socio-Economic Benefits of CO2 Mitigation Pathways to NAMAs in Thai Residential Sector

1318,Lessons Learnt from Thailand, ,"This section presents lessons learnt from Thailand in climate policy design. Thailand has filled the gap between modelling analyses and climate policy development in its Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA). Thailand’s mitigation pledge under NAMA framework was successfully designed and communicated to UNFCCC in COP20. The integrated assessment modelling analysis plays an important role in the development of Thailand NAMA. Consensus building was derived from several discussions among stakeholders of NAMA implementation. Criteria for selection of greenhouse gas countermeasures were based on cost optimization by using a module of the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model called ‘AIM/Enduse’, abatement costs, co-benefits and feasibility of implementation. In addition, economic feasibility of countermeasures in NAMA actions was also assessed. Then, NAMA implementation has been prepared based on assumptions concerning limitations of resources, capital requirement, timing and appropriateness for Thailand.
Since 2012 Thailand’s mitigation pledge to UNFCCC has been prepared on the basis of domestic appropriate measures. Co-benefits of NAMAs are also assessed, and they reveal positive aspects of GHG mitigation under NAMA framework. Results found that Thailand has high potential of GHG emission reduction by both domestically supported NAMAs and internationally supported NAMAs about 23–73 million tonnes CO2 per year in 2020 or approximately accounted for 7–20% in 2020 of the total GHG emissions.

In this study, the main objective is to investigate the performance of ANNs’ predictive ability for HVAC systems. The ANNs are applied to predict flow and temperatures of chilled water in HVAC systems of a multifunctional building in Thailand. The obtained model can be used to effectively plan the energy use of such systems. In addition, thermal energy storage can be properly managed, including its capacity and size. The main features representing temperature and humidity are ambient temperature and relative humidity of indoor and outdoor conditions.

A number of systems have been developed to meet these co-ordination challenges. However, these systems do not address the complexity of cascading disasters with domino effects in disaster impact to other locations, other types of disasters, often crossing borders. Co-ordination in these types of disasters is particularly challenging. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe supply chain co-ordination challenges on a macro and micro-economic level, and how these can be overcome in cascading disasters. Two illustrative cases are presented, the cascading effects of floods in the European Union vs. Thailand. The cases show that in spite of existing co-ordination mechanisms in place, local entities strive to secure their own area, thus putting neighbouring regions at higher risk. Such sub-optimisation in fact enhances the potential for cascading effects in disasters. In order to overcome these co-ordination problems, the paper suggests increased cross-country efforts and a focus on business continuity management.",2013/9,Supply chain co-ordination in cascading disasters

By far the biggest proportion of supply chain theory is bound up within North American and European business settings, hence its generalisability to culturally diverse global supply chains is investigated.
Methodology:
This exploratory research utilises the anthropological approach of observing supply chain manager behaviour in five distinct natural settings (Egypt, New Zealand, Japan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom). Hofstede’s (1980) well-known measures of work-related culture are used to explain the observed manager behaviours.
Research Implications:
Supply chain theory needs to be tailored to take account of culturally diverse settings as the optimal local supply chain architecture requires consideration of national, organisational and individual cultural norms. Similarly, change roadmap and management should also be matched to the local cultural environment.
Research Limitations:
A limited number of national settings, and cases in each setting, is investigated. Hence, significant scope exists for further exploratory research into the implications of cultural diversity for global supply chain management. Original contribution: The behaviour of supply chain managers in a range of national settings appears to be closely correlated with the national culture value set.

Temporary Shelters provide immediate accommodation, medical care and food to affected people (Bayram et al., 2015). Its contribution towards overall relief operations is 80%(Trunick, 2005), which makes it a critical element for a successful relief operation (Sheu, 2007). Thus, a failure of the humanitarian and relief supply chain can result in catastrophic consequences for the affected populations.
The field of humanitarian logistics has been extensively studied so far, especially during the last 10 years. Many literature reviews have been published so far on this topic (Altay and Green, 2006; Kovács and Spens, 2007; Pettit and Beresford, 2009; Natarajarathinam et al., 2009; Overstreet et al., 2011; Kunz and Reiner, 2012). However, they all take a different perspective and approach for analysing the literature. In opposition to earlier work, this study use a bibliometric mapping approach which is data driven and relies heavily on computer algorithms and visualization techniques. The approach can be seen as complementary to the earlier studies. In this study, we present the results of the bibliometric analysis the humanitarian logistics field, and in particular the presentation of maps of the …",2017,Bibliometric mapping of humanitarian logistics research

This is particularly true for the North–South Economic Corridor (NSEC), one branch of which extends from Kunming in the People’s Republic of China to Bangkok, Thailand. This branch, which is the focus of this paper, has three separate subcorridors. A methodology to assess the NSEC macro-logistics system and subcorridors was developed and validated with empirical and secondary data for the three subcorridors in the Kunming– Bangkok branch of the NSEC. Infrastructure connectivity in the NSEC is almost complete, but border crossings are still the weakest link in the macro-logistics system. An integrated approach is needed in order to solve this key problem. This approach should combine solutions to physical infrastructure issues with adherence to rules and regulations. The remaining challenge is how to transform the NSEC subcorridors into fully fledged economic subcorridors that can attract investment and generate economic activities in remote areas of the subcorridors, such as border crossings.",2008/12/1,"Logistics Development in the North-South Economic Corridor of the Greater Mekong Subregion, Journal of GMS Development Studies, Vol. 4, pp. 43-57"

Sustainable supply chain relates tosupply chain issues that can range from child labour andexploitation of workers at suppliers’ premises on one handto ozone depletion, deforestation and global warming onthe other. These sustainability dimensions can beanalysed through 3 main perspectives which are accordingto mainstream sustainability framework: theenvironmental, social, and economic consideration. Inorder for a supply chain to be sustainable, there is a needto balance these three proposed dimension ofsustainability.The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework toassess the sustainability of any supply chain based on thethree sustainability dimensions of the environment, socialand economic requirements.

However, the magnitude of appreciation among capital flows is close to each other. The increasing importance of merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in FDI in the region makes these flows behave closer to other forms of capital flow. The estimation results also show that during the estimation period, capital outflows bring about a greater degree of exchange rate adjustment than capital inflows.

The analysis is motivated by the decoupling thesis, which was a popular theme in Asian policy circles in the lead-up to the onset of the recent financial crisis, and aims to probe three key issues: Was the East Asian trade integration story that underpinned the decoupling thesis simply a statistical artifact or the massive export contraction caused by an overreaction of traders to the global economic crisis and/or by the drying up of trade credit, which overpowered the cushion provided by intra-regional trade? What are the new policy challenges faced by the East Asian economies? Is there room for an integrated policy response that marks a clear departure from the precrisis policy stance favoring export-oriented growth? The findings serve to caution against a possible costly backlash against openness to foreign trade arising from the newfound enthusiasm for rebalancing growth (redressing the strong bias for exports in development policy), and make a strong case for a well-coordinated strategy to fight new protectionism, as part of a long-term commitment to nondiscriminatory multilateral and unilateral trade liberalization.",2009,"Intra-regional trade in East Asia: The decoupling fallacy, crisis, and policy challenges"

The role of market structure in determining firms’ export decisions is also emphasized in the study. The key finding is that MNCs tend to be more export-oriented than indigenous firms and the entry of the former stimulates the latter to become involved in the production of exports, i.e., the presence of MNCs export spillovers. However, the impact of MNCs on export activity/spillovers is not automatic, but depends on the trade policy regime. A restricted trade policy, especially tariff protection, could retard the process of MNCs enhancing export spillovers and overall export activity. Competition fostered by open trade policies tend to be required if a high level of MNC participation is to be translated into higher export activity/spillovers. In addition, the negative direct effect of high tariff rates on export activity/spillovers highlights the relative importance of trade policy neutrality on firms’ export decisions and export spillovers.",2008/12/1,"Export performance, foreign ownership, and trade policy regime: Evidence from Thai Manufacturing"

In this paper, not only are both horizontal and vertical FDI technology spillovers examined, but the former is also assumed to vary across industries. The key hypothesis is that horizontal FDI spillovers depend on the trade policy regime as well as the absorptive capability of locally owned plants. Our panel data econometric analysis highlights the important role of the trade policy regime as a conditional gain of horizontal FDI spillovers. In particular, positive horizontal FDI spillovers are found only in an industry operating in a relatively liberal environment. Interestingly, imposing an assumption of identical horizontal FDI spillovers across industry could result in biased estimates of vertical FDI spillovers. The key policy inference highlights the relative importance of the trade policy regime in harnessing the gain from foreign presence. Liberalizing the foreign investment regime thus has to go hand in hand with liberalizing the trade policy to gain FDI technology spillovers. Our finding here gives a warning not to overemphasize the role of linkages. It is the quality rather than magnitude of linkages that should be used a proxy of the magnitude of vertical FDI spillovers.",2009/3,Vertical and horizontal FDI technology spillovers: evidence from Thai manufacturing

Second, it analyzes the determinants of changes in producer concentration at the industry level, highlighting the weak influence of majority-foreign ownership shares on these changes. It also shows how concentration tended to fall in industries with relatively high import protection, but this correlation was also weak. In contrast, there was a stronger tendency for concentration to rise in industries where shares of intra-industry conglomerates were relatively large in the initial year, although changes in conglomerate shares were not strongly correlated with changes in concentration. Third, incumbent firms, which were also among the largest firms in their respective industries in both years, had a strong tendency to be conglomerate members in both years, and a weak tendency to be majority-foreign owned in 1996, but not 2006. Exporting firms did not have a strong tendency to be among the largest firms, however. Firms that exited or entered samples of the largest firms between 1996 and 2006 did not have a strong tendency to be conglomerate members, majority-foreign owned, or exporters.

The global financial crisis has served to reveal the fragility of the decoupling thesis since all major East Asian countries, including China, have experienced precipitous trade contractions. Consequently, the policy debate in East Asia has made a U-turn from the complacency of the decoupling thesis to a call for the rebalancing of East Asian growth with a view to reducing its susceptibility to the vicissitudes of the global business cycle (ADB 2010; IMF 2010).",2010/7/1,"China and East Asian trade: the decoupling fallacy, crisis and policy challenges 10"

The key finding is that while there is growth in the number of FTAs with a potentially larger membership than existing FTAs, firms tend to prioritise existing FTAs. Moreover, only a narrow range of products are involved in applications for FTA preferential schemes. As a result, only one‐third of exports are covered by such arrangements. The key determinants of firms applying for preferential schemes include tariff margins, the ability to comply with rules of origins (ROOs) and the economic fundamentals influencing trade. Hence, it is less likely for FTAs to open up export opportunities for products that are either yet to be traded or of low prospective trade volume.

While our main finding is in favor of a liberal trade policy environment, we argue input and output tariffs should be treated separately in examining their impact on productivity. Ceteris paribus, lowering input tariffs potentially has at least two opposite effects. It allows firms to benefit in several ways, enhancing their productivity, while also discouraging their efforts to improve productivity due to the increased level of effective protection. This necessitates caution when pursuing trade policy reform in not placing too much focus on input tariffs while leaving output tariffs untouched. Even though input and output tariffs work differently in promoting firms’ productivity, any trade policy reform process should take both input and output tariffs into consideration in ensuring that trade is actually liberalized.",2017/6,Trade Protection and Firm Productivity: Evidence from T hai Manufacturing

The paper’s novel feature is to examine the different possible effects of fragmentation-driven parts and final good imports on the price-cost margin. Our key finding suggests that while imports have the potential to act as a market discipline, the effect on the price-cost margin appears to be different between two categories of imports. It is the importation of parts and components instead of final goods that acts as a market discipline. The higher the proportion of imported parts, the closer the gap between the price and marginal cost, thereby promoting more efficient use of scarce resources. For a small domestic market such as Thailand and other developing countries, it would be difficult for individual plants to reach the industry’s economies of scale by relying entirely on the domestic market. For firms whose manufactured goods are exported, it is more likely that they will benefit from economies of scale. The paper provides more empirical evidence of gains from opening up international trade on resource allocation and the need for further liberalization. The finding also highlights gains from participating in global production networks in terms of growth opportunity and resource allocation efficiency.",2010/3,Imports-as-Market Discipline Hypothesis: Evidence from the Thai Manufacturing Sector

Production processes are vertically separated into two or more stages and across two or more countries through the extensive use of outsourcing and intra-firm trade (Jones and Kierkowski, 2001; Athukorala and Yamashita, 2006). 1 In this process a country no longer needs to specialize in the entire production of a product, and may choose to focus instead on some specific segments of products. Some segments of the lower end of the supply chain have been moved to several developing countries where production costs are relatively cheaper. As a consequence, there has been a rapid increase of trade in parts and components linking countries with different stages of production (Yeats, 2001; Yamashita, 2010). This paper examines the development of trade in supply chains for ASEAN countries and especially their linkages with China. China is becoming an increasingly important trading nation for ASEAN economies. China overtook Germany in 2010 to become the world’s largest exporter. China’s growing importance has created concerns among other Asian exporting countries who fear that competition with China is crowding out their own export opportunities (the ‘China fear’). However, it is now clear that for many Asian countries China’s formidable growth has also created opportunities for exports to China (Eichengreen et al., 2007; Greenaway et al., 2008; Athukorala, 2009; Coxhead and Jayasuriya, 2010).

The paper’s novel feature is that R&D investment is sub-divided into three broad categories, ie R&D leading to improved production technology to product development, and to process innovation. In addition, three key globalization forces, namely MNEs, exporting, and global production networks, are examined in a single framework over and above industry and firm-specific factors. Our key finding is that the determinants of each type of R&D are far from identical, suggesting that it is necessary to distinguish between the types of R&D when examining their determinants. The statistical significance of firm-specific factors found in our research suggests that the decision to carry out R&D largely depends on the firm’s profitability, and is therefore unlikely to be stimulated by policyinduced incentives. The role of government in this regard should emphasize the availability of infrastructure services and their adequacy for all types of R&D activities. Globalization through exporting and FDI can play a role in encouraging firms to commit to R&D investment. The latter has an indirect effect in encouraging locally-owned firms to engage in R&D investment whereas the former has a direct effect on R&D leading to product development.

In the recent literature on international trade, an array of alternative terms has been used to describe IPNs including international production fragmentation, vertical specialization, slicing the value chain and outsourcing (Athukorala, 2006). IPNs open up opportunities for countries to specialize in different segments of the production process, depending on the relative cost advantage and other economic fundamentals. Consequently, parts and components are now exchanged across borders at a faster rate than final goods. In this context, the decisions on how much to produce and for which market have to be combined with decisions on where to produce and to what degree of intra-product specialization (Athukorala, 2006).
A consensus in the recent literature1 on international trade points to the increasing importance of IPNs in East Asian economies, as opposed to North America and Europe. They become an integral part of export dynamism in the region, which thus results in a further impact on overall economic performance. In addition, IPN trade tends to be far more sensitive to cross-border barriers than is final goods trade, as goods under IPNs go through border controls several times (Yi, 2003). Hence, a low tariff rate on parts creates considerably adverse effects on the international competitiveness of final goods.

The discussion covers both FDI (foreign direct investment) and non-FDI channels of MNE involvement in the export of four major items, namely, canned pineapple, canned tuna, processed chicken, and processed shrimp. The findings suggest that MNEs play a vital role in the expansion of processed food exports from Thailand. MNE involvement begins with the establishment of joint ventures with Thai firms (FDI channel). Then, other local firms engage in export-oriented production and enhance their competitiveness through technology spillover. As the industry gains maturity, links with MNE buyers begin to play a far more important role than the FDI channel. The highly liberal trade and investment policy regime of Thailand, as well as the absorptive capability of local firms and the presence of the Thai MNE, CP group, are important elements of the enabling environment that allows these Thai exporting firms to gain maximum benefits from MNE involvement.

The analysis is based on in-depth interviewing with 50 clothing firms in Thailand during November 2009-February 2010. The key finding is that not all firms opt to hire unskilled foreign workers (henceforth foreign workers). There are systematic differences in firm characteristics between firms who hire foreign workers and those who do not. The latter are relatively large in size (both employment and sales), perform better, and actively undertake upgrading activities. The former are struggling to maintain their profit margin, are relatively small, and do not adequately invest in upgrading activities. Interestingly, hiring foreign workers is not firms’ first response but is a reflection of the fact that they have not yet been successful in undertaking functional upgrading. While there are many kinds of upgrading (service, product and functional), our finding points to the relative importance of functional upgrading for long-term and more sustainable development. Firms which were late in undertaking functional upgrading are likely to hire foreign workers during their structural adjustment process. Allowing unskilled foreign workers on a temporary basis would be a win-win-win solution for labor importing and exporting countries, as well as for the migrants themselves. Nevertheless, a condition for firms hiring unskilled foreign workers must be related to preventing any retarding effect on upgrading effort. Three policy inferences can be made from this paper.

Our study compares the effects of technological advancements on labour market outcomes with import penetration, delineating into raw materials, capital goods, and final products. Our results show that in Thailand, the impact of advanced technology in pushing workers out of the job market is limited. Instead, it tends to affect reallocation of workers between skilled and unskilled positions. The results vary amongst proxies of technology and sectors. It seems that workers in comparatively capital-intensive industries, including automotive, plastics and chemicals, and electronics and machinery, are the most affected by advanced technology. Dampened wage/income is found only in some proxies of technology and sectors.

Worldwide, the number of FTAs involving reciprocal tariff reductions jumped from 124 in 1994 to 625 by February 2016, nearly 70 percent of which are currently in force. 1 FTAs are expected to proliferate further. The newly launched agreements tend to be over and above existing FTAs with the hope of consolidating and overcoming the problems of the existing agreements. A clear example here is the ongoing negotiation of an FTA among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members–japan, the Republic of Korea (hereafter, Korea), China, India, Australia and New Zealand–known as the Regional Economic Comprehensive Partnership (RCEP).
Nonetheless, the extent to which the signed FTAs are utilised and firms’ perceptions of the business opportunities that emerge from these FTAs are important for designing these new agreements. The expected effect on trade induced by a signed FTA is conditional on various factors, such as the complexity of the rules of origin (RoOs)(criteria to prove product originality) that are imposed and implemented, tariff margins, and pre-trading volumes. The tradeenhancing effect of FTAs, therefore, varies across products but also across FTAs (Figure 6.1).

There is much general agreement in the development economics and political economy literature about the factors that underpin rapid economic development. These include macroeconomic stability; openness to trade, investment, and technology; a stable and business-friendly commercial environment; mechanisms that ensure broad-based,‘inclusive’development; and investment in supply-side capabilities, ranging from infrastructure to human capital. The contestation focuses on whether these general, economywide approaches are sufficient, or whether in addition there is a role for sector-specific interventions. The earlier literature focused on the merits of import substitution versus export orientation and the case for outward-looking development strategies. Both the analytical literature, including the famous Bhagwati–-Krueger studies and much else, and the empirical investigations demonstrated conclusively that outward-looking economies generally grow faster over the long term. 1 In response, and recognizing the inevitability of global economic integration, the contemporary literature has focused on whether there is a case for ‘smart industry policy’in broadly open economies. Here the arguments typically centre on dynamic externalities, learning by doing, linkages, and various forms of technological acquisition that will not be forthcoming if ‘left to the market’.

Controlling for firms’ global participation, which is defined as export-sale ratio and the extent to which raw materials are imported, our study finds that trade liberalization could induce firms to commit to activities that improve productivity. The effective rate of protection, where output and input tariffs are taken into consideration together, matters in improving firm productivity. Thus, it would be risky to continue tariff reform by focusing solely on a reduction in input tariffs while leaving output tariffs untouched.

Our key finding is that while firm-specific variables such as years of operation, R&D activities, a number of skill workers employed have positive effect on productivity, modes in which firms are integrated into the global economy like market orientation and foreign partnership positively attribute to their productivity. Firms operating in more restrictive trade policy register lower productivity than those in more liberal environment.

1584,Archanun Kohpaiboon, ,"Enticing multinational enterprises (MNEs) to set up aff liations is high on the policy agenda in many countries, especially developing ones, as their entry would bring in much-needed capital, new productiontechnologies, marketing techniques and management know-how. While all of these potential benef ts of foreign direct investment (FDI) are viewed as important, particular emphasis is placed on technological gains in the productivity and competitiveness of the domestic industry, known as FDI technology spillovers (henceforth referred to as ‘FDI spillovers’). As a result, the expectation of gaining from technology spillover persuades many developing countries to offer various incentives in order to attract FDI. Nonetheless, only in some investment-receiving (host) countries are FDI spillovers empirically found.
While tangible efforts have recently been made to gain a better understanding of the factors that determine the presence of FDI spillovers, they have not thus far borne fruit (Crespo and Fontoura 2007). The existing literature divides into two broad themes. First, horizontal FDI spillovers are assumed not to be automatic but are hypothesized to be a function of the economic environment and domestic policies in host countries. In this literature, two determinants have been generally recognized as conditioning gains from FDI: the trade policy regime and the absorptive capability of locally owned enterprises. 2 While both of these factors are acknowledged, most researchers have examined only the role of absorptive capability. This may be because of the diffic lty of fi dinga reliable proxyfor protection across industries. So far only a few studies (eg …",2012/6/25,8 Vertical and horizontal FDI technology spillovers

1586,"Archanun Kohpaiboon, Nipon Poapongsakorn", ,"This paper illustrates the upgrading experiences of the automotive and hard disk drive (HDD) industries in Thailand, chosen because of their outstanding export performance in the developing world. An understanding of their upgrading experiences can shed some light on the ongoing debate regarding the relative importance of international production networks (IPNs) and industrial clusters (ICs) and their implications for prudential industrial policy. The impact of the recent global recession is also discussed in this paper. There is evidence of industrial upgrading in both the automotive and HDD industries. Yet one primary policy challenge still remains, that is, the limited role of indigenous suppliers in the multinational enterprise (MNE) production networks. This limited role is, to a certain extent, related to the overall incentive structure. Where these two industries differ is in their mode of networking, that is, whether they are part of an IPN or an IC. In the case of the automotive industry, industrial clustering has been observed and has reached a level where the local content of a locally manufactured vehicle is approaching 100%. In the case of the HDD industry, industrial clustering has naturally occurred and reached a certain level. Even though the current global economic crisis has severely affected each industry’s production and exports, the “hollow out” scenario is unlikely to apply to either. In other words, Thailand should remain a base of production and exports for MNEs, a situation which points to the need for continual industrial upgrading.

The focus is on how firms at the border make use of the opportunity to access low-wage foreign workers to enhance their competitiveness. The key findings suggest that there are a number of export-oriented, small-and medium-sized enterprises setting up clothing factories in Tak province to access lowwage foreign workers in order to maintain their competitiveness. Postulated in the literature on labour migration is the potential adverse effect that importing low-wage foreign workers has on technological progress. This has not been found in the case of the Thai clothing industry, due to persistence of global competition. While this study’s outcome cannot be treated as strong evidence in favour of widely opening the door to foreign workers, our findings argue for less concern about its adverse effect on technological progress. Firms, regardless their workers’ nationality (local versus foreign), must stay alert to any activities that will improve productivity in order to survive amidst intense competition.

Thailand is selected because there were several FTAs that have entered in force for a year (2005). The methodology employed in this paper is a combination between quantitative index, record of preferential exports and firm interview in which rules of origin (RoO) are well taken into consideration. The key finding is that RoO undermined FTA export creation effect on Thai manufacturing export. As suggested by the uncovered negative relationship between backward linkage index, a proxy of ability to comply with RoO and export-sale ratio of 92 industries, the higher the degree of export orientation the less the ability to comply with RoO. This statistical relationship is consistent with the FTA utilization rates (the ratio of preferential export to total export) for all FTAs. Only did a handful of industries registered preferential rates greater than 70 per cent, one of which is car manufacturing industry. Firm interviews point to an insignificant effect of FTA export creation. There has not been any significant difference in export pattern between before-and after-FTA implementation periods.

The analysis reveals that the degree of dependence of these countries on this new form of global division of labour in East Asia is much larger compared to Europe and North America. Global production sharing has certainly strengthened economic interdependence among the countries in the region, but the dynamism of the regional cross-border production networks depends inexorably on global, rather than regional, trade in final goods. The findings of this paper make a strong case for a global, rather than a regional, approach to trade and investment policy making.","This paper documents and analyzes emerging trade patterns in Asia, with special reference to the implications of the development of global production sharing with a view to informing the contemporary policy debate on forming two mega-FTA initiatives, Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

Since the background species may inhibit or promote arsenic removal. The influence of several common ions such as phosphate (PO43−), bicarbonate (HCO3−), sulfate (SO42−), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl−), and humic acid (HA) were selected to evaluate their effects on arsenic removal. In particular, a 26−2 fractional factorial design (FFD) was employed to identify major or interacting factors, which affect arsenic removal in a significant way. As a result of FFD evaluation, PO43− and HA play the role of inhibiting arsenic removal, while Ca2+ was observed to play the promoting one. As for HCO3− and Cl−, the former one inhibits As(III) removal, whereas the later one enhances its removal; on the other hand, As(V) removal was affected only slightly in the presence of HCO3− or Cl−.

The video is divided into shots by the proposed automatic shot boundary detection using local singular value decomposition and k-means clustering. Shots that contain the useless contents were eliminated by our proposed technique integrated a near duplicated key frame (NDK) algorithm. The local features of each remaining frames were extracted using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. The similarity between consecutive frames was calculated using SIFT matching and then converted into a string. The given strings were then concatenated into a longer string sequence to use as a shot representation. The similarity between each pair of sequences was evaluated using the longest common subsequence algorithm. Our method was evaluated in direct comparison with the conventional technique.

In the synthesis, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was employed as a silica source and pluronic (P123) was chosen as a structure directing agent. The mixture was heated at various temperatures (30 C-60 C) and reaction times (2-4 hours). The obtained product was treated by hydrothermal and dried in hot air oven. Finally, it was calcined at 600 C to yield nanoporous silica of different physical properties. Indigo carmine was subsequently loaded by soaking the silica in the solution of indigo carmine for 48 hours. The releasing rate of the model drug was evidently affected by the physical properties of the nanoporous silica prepared. At the condition of 60 C for 4 hours, the releasing was high because the pore size of the silica was too large comparing with the molecular size of indigo carmine. Furthermore, high temperature also increased the polymerization resulting in a reduction of silanol group (Si-OH) need for binding with the model drug. At temperature of 30 C, the pore size was too small for indigo carmine.

Introduction Concerns about depleting fossil resources and increasing CO2 emission are driving a strong demand for alternatives to petroleum as feedstock for the chemical industry. Nanocellulose is advantageous in this regard because it is abundant, inexpensive and renewable, and can be processed large scale using-well established wood industry method 1). It is one of the most fundamental raw materials for the fabrication of the environmentally friendly products 2) 3). However, its waterproof properties are poor due to the existing of three hydroxyl groups (–OH) on each glucose unit in the structure. Thus, the exploration a facile method to convert the inherent hydrophilicity of nanocellulose into a hydrophobicity is critical for utilization in research and potential applications in the packaging area. Many fundamental reports on fabricating hydrophobic surfaces of soft materials, such as paper, cotton fabric or textile were obtained by the self-assembly method with covalently attached silanes on the surface of substrates. For instance, hydrophobic surface paper with water contact angle (WCA) of 157 and WCA> 110 were fabricated via an immersion-solution method in the potassium methyl siliconate solution and three different silane couple agents, respectively 4) 5).

The catalyst structure was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Remarkably, the Ni-Cu/mCM catalysts increased the produced alkyl-phenols by up to fourfold, and these products are an excellent gasoline blend stock due to their high blending octane number. At the same time, the mass of undesired compounds in the bio-oil including alcohols, ketones, and furan were markedly decreased compared to the case without a catalyst. The oxygen content of the bio-oil was reduced by up to 24 % compared to the non-catalytic case. The hydrogen/carbon and oxygen/carbon molar ratios were also improved after all catalytic treatments.

Introduction The expanding global utilization of energy in daily life is of increasing concern due to the limited availability of non-renewable energy resources and the increasing level of air pollution. The solution to these problems requires not only the availability of new renewable energy resources, but also the need for a more effective utilization of energy. Biomass is an alternative, sustainably renewable energy resource that often does not cause pollution, and is considered more environmentally friendly through its zero carbon footprint. Carbon could turn out to be the most promising candidate for future energy storage 1) 2). Carbon nanotubes have gained a lot of recent attention as supercapacitor electrodes because they present remarkable mechanical, chemical and electrical properties 3) 4). Graphene and modified graphene electrodes have a good capacitance of up to 442 Fg-1 due to their unique structure with a high electrochemical surface area 5)~ 7). However, the severity of the conditions of their synthesis, involving a high temperature with flammable methane gas, and the high production cost are limiting factors. Recently, carbon derived from biomass waste under a more simple and mild synthesis condition has gained more interest for electrode preparation than conventional nanostructured carbon, because biomass waste is readily available and cheap.

Rubber seed oil consists of 10.2% palmitic acid (C16: 0), 8.7% stearic acid (C18: 0), 24.6% oleic acid (C18: 1), 39.6% linoleic acid (C18: 2) and 16.3% linolenic acid (C18: 3). The amount of free fatty acid (FFA) in RSO is relatively high, which causes saponification problems in the presence of alkaline catalysts. Acid catalysts are thus used to prevent such reactions. Many types of acid catalyst have been employed for biodiesel production including ferric alginate beads, aminophosphonic acid resin D418, acid-activated carbon and sulfonic acid-functionalized SBA-15 catalysts 5) 6) 7) 8). In this work, CH3/SO3H-MCM-41 (Fig. 1) is used as a catalyst for biodiesel production from RSO as it offers advantageous characteristics such as high surface area, high activity in transesterification and the potential for reuse. The presence of a methyl group (-CH3) at the active site (SO3H-group) encourages efficient mass transfer and maintains the durability of the catalyst due to the anti-adsorption of polar molecules such as glycerol and water on the surface of the catalyst during transesterification reactions 9).

Insufficient contact pressure and filler metal resulted in the formation of cavities within the joint. The causes of cavities were imperfect wettability of melted filler metal on substrate surfaces as well as entrapped gas within joints. At low contact pressure and a small amount of filler metal, a significant amount of Cu3P was drawn into an opening and formed Cu3P phases at the middle of the joint. At high contact pressure and a large amount of filler metal, the flux and excess melted Cu3P were pressured out of an opening; therefore, joint microstructure was a uniform combination between Cu3P and Cu-Zn-Sn phases. Joint strength was influenced by the formation of cavities and Cu3P phase. Cavities were the sites of crack initiation due to their high stress concentration.

The proposed method takes multiple adjacent frames of a speech signal into account by combining their log spectra into multivariate signals. The multivariate signals are then decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The IMFs are divided into two groups using the peak of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of an IMF. The first group characterized by a spectral fine structure is used to estimate the fundamental frequency F0 by using the ACF, whereas the second group characterized by the frequency response of the vocal-tract filter is used to estimate formant frequencies by using a peak picking technique. There are two advantages of using MEMD:(i) the variation in the number of IMFs is eliminated in contrast with singleframe based empirical mode decomposition and (ii) the common information of the adjacent frames aligns in the same order of IMFs because of the common mode alignment property of MEMD. These advantages make the analysis more accurate than with other methods.

One of the diagnostic tools for breast cancer screening is the ultrasound. Ultrasounds are characterized by low cost and non-invasive patterns. A major drawback of ultrasound is the multiplicative speckle noise. Speckle noise limits the effectiveness of images thereby reducing the efficiency of the test. This paper proposes a new algorithm to reduce noise.
Methods
The method is based on the combination of the multiscale approach, the wiener filter, and the new fast bilateral filter. A multiscale image was first created. Subsequently, the wiener filter was used for initial filtering and to reduce the mean square error of the multiscaled images. Finally, the new fast bilateral filter was used to remove speckle noise.
Results
The algorithm was tested on 50 synthetic images degraded by speckle noise with varying intensity and 250 breast ultrasound (BUS) images from two datasets. The results were compared with …",2021/4/1,Multiscale hybrid algorithm for pre-processing of ultrasound images

In the digital health era, mobile phone fundus photography has evolved into a low-cost alternative to the standard ophthalmoscope. Existing image processing algorithms have a problem with handling the narrow field of view and poor quality of retinal images from a mobile phone. This paper enhances the accuracy of our previously proposed scheme, ADI-GVF snakes, to improve the segmentation of the optic disk (OD) and the optic cup (OC) for glaucoma pre-screening [1] from retinal images obtained from a mobile phone. This work integrated a better OD localization method, namely, the exclusion method (EM) with ADI-GVF segmentation for the OD and the OC. The improved algorithm can segment the regions of the OD and OC more accurately, resulting in a more precise value of the cup-to-disk area ratio (CDAR). The proposed method yields as high as 93.33% for true positive rate (TPR) and 93.87% for true negative rate (TNR) and as low as 6.12% and 6.66% for false omission rate (FOR), and false discovery rate (FDR).

2136,"M Munlin, SS Makhanov", ,"When the tool of a five-axis milling machine travels across or around a stationary point the rotation angles jump considerably leading to unexpected deviations from the prescribed trajectories. Consequently, the inverse kinematics of five-axis milling machines produces large errors near the stationary points. We propose two new algorithms to repair the trajectories by adjusting the rotation angles in such a way that the kinematics error is minimized. The first algorithm is based on global optimization procedure to minimize the kinematics error with regard to feasible solutions of the inverse kinematics. We show that such optimization increases the accuracy of the milling operations and is the most appropriate in the case of a rough-cut. The optimization algorithm is based on the iterative shortest path scheme. The shortest path procedure can be applied to either the entire set of trajectories or to only the most inappropriate trajectories inside the work piece. The second algorithm is based on the equi distribution with regard to the rotation angles. The kinematics error near the stationary points is much more sensitive to the variation of the rotation angles than to the spatial variations. Therefore, the method inserts additional tool positions by finding numerically a grid of points equi distributed in the angular increments. We prove that near the stationary points the proposed method may require 10-15 times less additional points than the conventional scheme.","When the tool of a five-axis milling machine travels across or around a stationary point the rotation angles jump considerably leading to unexpected deviations from the prescribed trajectories.

Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) are common in Parkinson’s disease (PD). While prevalence of each NMS in Thai PD patients is unknown, these NMS might have an impact on patients’ wellbeing. The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence, pattern and impact of NMS on the quality of life in Thai PD patients.
Methods:
A cross-sectional study in 115 PD patients was conducted at Thammasat University hospital. Subtype of PD, Schwab & England activity of daily living (ADL scale), Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score and the modified Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y scale) were recorded. NMS and quality of life were assessed using Thammasat University Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (TU-NMSQuest) and Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8).
Results:
All patients reported at least one NMS. A mean number of 15.94±6.48 NMS was reported by each patient. Nocturia (79.1%), urinary urgency (73%), and fatigue (71.3%) were the most prevalent NMS. Significant correlations were observed between TU-NMSQuest and UPDRS motor score, H&Y scale, ADL scale, subtype of PD, and PDQ-8.
Conclusion:
NMS are common and have a significant impact on the quality of life in PD patients. Advanced disease stage, poorer motor or ADL function, and non-tremor dominant subtype are associated with a higher number of NMS and lower quality of life in Thai PD patients.",2014/6/1,"Non-motor symptoms in Thai Parkinson’s disease patients: prevalence, manifestation and health related quality of life"

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an inherited cerebellar degeneration associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions in the TATA-binding protein gene (TBP). Low-range expansions of TBP have recently been described in association with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these low-range expansion alleles were also observed in healthy individuals. Prior distinct findings may result from reduced penetrance or age-dependent susceptibility, which may influence phenotypic expression.

Status epilepticus (SE) is an emergency condition with high mortality rate, particularly in patients whose treatment is delayed. This is to describe clinical characteristics, treatment process, and outcome and to determine clinical parameters which impact the SE outcome.
Methods:
This was a descriptive study in 60 SE patients admitted between 2004-2011 to the Thammasat University Hospital, Pathumthani, Thailand. The correlation between the outcome and clinical parameters was analyzed.
Results:
Sixty SE patients were included (38 men; 22 women), mean age 55 years. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus was the most common (55 events, 91.6%). Forty-three patients (71.7%) had previous diagnosis of neurological disorders. AED withdrawal and old ischemic stroke were the common causes of SE. The mean time from onset to treatment was 163.4 minutes and door to needle time was 19.8 minutes. Diazepam and phenytoin were most commonly used as first and second line AED. Eight patients (13%) developed refractory SE. The mortality rate was 25%, with 28.3% in total dependent state, 20% had incomplete recovery, and 26.7% had complete recovery. The risk factors which correlated with death were old age, long duration of seizure and coma.

2193,Kongkiat Kulkantrakorn,4,"Knowledge in neuropathic pain has grown rapidly during the past few years. Central and peripheral sensitization is still believed to be the main pathophysiology. New evidence suggests many potential new molecular targets and mechanisms, such as cytokines, lysophosphatidic acid and ion channels. Microglia and astrocyte activation leads to dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines and pain signaling. Many subtypes of the sodium channel have been shown to be the culprit for both congenital and acquired pain syndromes, especially small fiber neuropathy. Lysophosphatidic acid is thought to act as an initiator of neuropathic pain, along with other mediators. Animal models of neurodegenerative diseases and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy reaffirm the role of nociceptor degeneration and cytoskeletal breakdown in peripheral neuropathy. With better understanding of its mechanism, it may lead to new therapeutic targets. Recent trials of new medications, new formulations or new indication of old drugs have shown promising data.

Nerve conduction study (NCS) is the important diagnostic tool in Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS). Many electrodiagnostic criteria sets have been proposed to distinguish demyelinating from axonal pathology. Misclassification often occurs in early course of the disease. Moreover, timing and selection of the nerves are crucial. Repeated NCS may provide more definite diagnosis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe NCS results and their serial changes in specific nerves and related parameters.

2241,Kongkiat Kulkantrakorn, ,"Knowledge in neuropathic pain has grown rapidly during the past few years. Central and peripheral sensitization is still believed to be the main pathophysiology. New evidence suggests many potential new molecular targets and mechanisms, such as cytokines, lysophosphatidic acid and ion channels. Microglia and astrocyte activation leads to dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines and pain signaling. Many subtypes of the sodium channel have been shown to be the culprit for both congenital and acquired pain syndromes, especially small fiber neuropathy. Lysophosphatidic acid is thought to act as an initiator of neuropathic pain, along with other mediators. Animal models of neurodegenerative diseases and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy reaffi rm the role of nociceptor degeneration and cytoskeletal breakdown in peripheral neuropathy. With better understanding of its mechanism, it may lead to new therapeutic targets. Recent trials of new medications, new formulations or new indication of old drugs have shown promising data.

Method: A Retrospective study (between 1997 and 2007) including 12 patients with primary Gougerot Sjogren syndrome, selected according to the criteria developed by the European-American consensus group revised in 2002. Results: There were 12 patients with a sex ratio 11W/1M whose average age was 44.8 years old. The neurological affection was revealed in all cases. The clinical state was marked by subacute combined egeneration of the spinal cord syndrome (2 cases), Devic’s syndrome (2cases), an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis syndrome (2cases), a medullar section syndrome (1case), periodical paralysis (1case), meningoencephalitis (1case), a poly sensorimotor neuropathy (1case), a sensory neuropathy (1case) and a spastic tetra paresis associated to a depressive syndrome and trigeminal neuralgia (1case). All the patients received oral corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide was used in 5 cases. The evolution was good in 5 cases, worsening of disorders in 2 cases, a steady state in 4 cases and death in 1 case.
Conclusion: Neurological affection in the SGS is noticed in 8 to 70% of the cases according to studies. It is marked by clinical diversity dominated by peripheral neuropathies where sensitive affection prevails. The central affection is usually polymorphic. In our series, it was an isolated peripheral affection in five cases, isolated central affection was noted in five cases. In both cases, the affection was mixed.

Aspirin is the well-known antiplatelet agent and best studied for stroke prevention. It inhibits platelet activation by irreversibly inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase and thromboxane production. Recent meta-analysis suggests that the benefit of aspirin is independent of dosage and now, lower dosage is favored due to low side-effect profiles. The adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists which are ticlopidine and clopidogrel are slightly more effective than aspirin in high-risk patients. However, they have different side effect profile and higher price. There no clearer role for other agents such as dipyridamole or oral GP IIb I IlIa receptor antagonist as single agent for prevention.

To report three patients with NMT who had other associated immune-mediated conditions, i.e., myasthenia gravis, thymoma and various types of peripheral neuropathies. One patient had peripheral neuropathy and involvement of pre- and post-synaptic neuromuscular junction.
Results:
All three patients had evidence of polyneuropathy and neuromyotonic discharges on electrodiagnostic studies. Elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies were noted in all patients and malignant thymoma was found in two patients with metastasis. All three patients showed moderate to marked response to plasma exchange.

This paper describes an approach to apply term distributions, in addition to tf and idf, to improve performance of centroid-based text categorization. Three types of term distributions, called inter-class, intra-class and in-collection distributions, are introduced. These distributions are useful to increase classification accuracy by exploiting information of (1) term distribution among classes, (2) term distribution within a class and (3) term distribution in the whole collection of training data. In addition, this paper investigates how these term distributions contribute to weight each term in documents, e.g., a high term distribution of a word promotes or demotes importance or classification power of that word. To this end, several centroid …",2004/1/1,Effect of term distributions on centroid-based text categorization

While many computational techniques have been proposed to improve predictive performance for protein subcellular location, they have several shortcomings.

Towards these issues, this work presents a new computational method for predicting proteins which have either single or multiple locations.

If the dictionary is not sufficiently good, it will lead to a great number of unknown or unrecognized words. These unrecognized words certainly reduce segmentation accuracy. To solve such problem, we propose a method based on decision tree models. Without use of a dictionary, specific information, called syntactic attribute, is applied to identify the structure of Thai words. C4. 5 is used as a tool for this purpose. Using a Thai corpus, experiment results show that our method outperforms some well-known dictionary-dependent techniques, maximum and longest matching methods, in case of no dictionary.",2001,Non-dictionary-based Thai word segmentation using decision trees

This paper presents a new approach to straightforwardly combine a rule-based system (RB) with a probabilistic graphical inference framework, i.e., naïve Bayesian network (BN), towards probabilistic argumentation via a so-called probabilistic assumption-based argumentation (PABA) framework. A rule-based system (RB) formalizes its rules into defeasible logic under the assumption-based argumentation (ABA) framework while the Bayesian network (BN) provides probabilistic reasoning. By knowledge integration, while the former provides a solid testbed for inference, the latter helps the former to solve persistent conflicts by setting an acceptance threshold.

This paper presents an approach to use term-distribution statistics extracted from a small number of cue instances with their known classes, for term weightings as indirect distance constraint. As for distribution-based term weighting, three types of term-oriented standard deviations are exploited: distribution of a term in a collection (SD), average distribution of a term in a class (ACSD), and average distribution of a term among classes (CSD). These term weightings are explored with the consideration of symmetry concepts by varying the magnitude to positive and negative for promoting and demoting effects of three standard deviations. In k-means, followed the symmetry concept, both seeded and unseeded centroid initializations are investigated and compared to the centroid-based classification. Our experiment is conducted using five English text collections and one Thai text collection, ie, Amazon, DI, WebKB1, WebKB2, and 20Newsgroup, as well as TR, a collection of Thai reform-related opinions. Compared to the conventional TFIDF, the distribution-based term weighting improves the centroid-based method, seeded k-means, and k-means with the error reduction rate of 22.45%, 31.13%, and 58.96%.",2020/6,Document Clustering Using K-Means with Term Weighting as Similarity-Based Constraints

In many Thai news categories, referential ambiguity is often found, ie, in addition to its formal names, an entity is often referred to by other names, called name aliases. Name co-occurrence information is very useful for name-alias relationship identification, and it is usually represented by a co-occurrence matrix in the vector space model. Traditionally, a cooccurrence matrix is constructed by multiplying a weighted name-by-document matrix, possibly normalized, and its transpose. This paper proposes an alternative co-occurrence matrix construction method using association measures. The effects of association measures are investigated by comparing their use with the traditional co-occurrence matrix construction method. Various complementary factors are considered in the comparison, eg, weighting schemes, a normalization process, and linkage functions for hierarchical clustering. Two collections of Thai news articles, 1,000 articles in the domain of football and 1,000 articles in the domain of politics, are used in experiments.

While some recent methods exploited an evolutional approach to construct a suitable multifunction kernel, most of them searched randomly and diversely. In this paper, the concept of a family of identical-structured kernel trees is proposed to enable exploration of structure space using genetic programming whereas to pursue investigation of parameter space on a certain tree using evolution strategy. To control balance between structure and parameter search towards an optimal kernel, simulated annealing is introduced. By experiments on a number of benchmark datasets in the UCI and text classification collection, the proposed method is shown to be able to find a better optimal solution than other search methods, including grid search and gradient search.",2010/4/1,A family-based evolutional approach for kernel tree selection in SVMs

The question sent to each examinee depends on his/her answers to previous questions. One drawback is that CAT is not suitable for a small examination pool since it may not guarantee to cover all topics. The purpose of this study is to introduce a new adaptive testing method called Comparable Item Reduction CAT which has many attractive features such as the ability to operate on an item pool whose size is fixed and to assure that all topics are distributed equally and efficiently. The result is the test that is shorter in length and accurate in each examineepsilas ability estimation.,2008/9/21,A comparability approach to item reduction in Computerized Adaptive Testing

This work presents a method to apply latent semantic indexing in frequent itemset mining to discover potential relations among scientific publications. In this work, two weighting schemes, tf and tfidf are investigated with the exploitation of latent semantic indexing. The proposed method is evaluated using a set of technical documents in a publication database by comparing the extracted document relations with their references (citations). To this end, the paper uses order accumulative citation matrices to evaluate the validity (quality) of discovered patterns. The results also show that the proposed method successfully discovers a set of document relations, comparing to the original method that uses no latent semantic indexing.",2008/5/20,Applying latent semantic indexing in frequent itemset mining for document relation discovery

Based on sliding-window rule application and extraction filtering, we present a framework for extracting semantic information from medical-symptom phrases with unknown boundaries in Thai free-text information entries. A supervised rule learning algorithm is employed for automatic construction of information extraction rules from hand-tagged training symptom phrases. Two filtering components are introduced: one uses a classification model for predicting rule application across a symptom-phrase boundary, the other uses extraction distances observed during rule learning for resolving conflicts arising from overlapping-frame extractions. In our experimental study, we focus our attention on two basic types of symptom phrasal descriptions: one is concerned with abnormal characteristics of some observable entities and the other with human-body locations at which symptoms appear. The experimental results show that the filtering components improve precision while preserving recall satisfactorily.",2008,The semantic web

Since the last century, several schemes for Thai Romanization have been proposed. Although the Royal Institute of Thailand has issued a standard principle for Thai Romanization, it is still not widely used. It is also not straightforward to develop an automatic system for Romanizing Thai words based on the available rules since there are many exceptional cases. In this paper, we propose a corpus-based approach for automatically Romanizing Thai words. Applying a corpus of Thai-English Romanization pairs, each Thai-English word pair is decomposed to a sequence of substrings called Thai Character Cluster (TCC) and English Character Cluster (ECC). After mapping a TCC with its corresponding ECC, the probabilistic trigram model is created and then applied to determine the most proper transcription of an input Thai word. We evaluate the proposed approach by conducting a number of experiments. The experimental results show that the approach achieves approximately 99.6% for the close test and nearly 93.4% for the open test for TCC-level evaluation.",2007,A Corpus-based Approach for Thai Romanization

By these representations, word senses of an ambiguous word are represented in the expression that can be used immediately in disambiguation process by not individualizing these word senses. Consequently, the complexity in semantic disambiguation process is improved, independent of the number of word senses of a word.

We investigate two corpora, which are Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database (IEMOCAP) and Emotional Tagged Corpus on Lakorn (EMOLA). The first corpus is an English language corpus whereas the second one is a Thai language corpus, and both are annotated by six annotators. We primarily study only four emotions, which are anger, happiness, neutral, and sadness. The experimental results show that, once the emotionally ambiguous utterances are removed from a corpus by the proposed methods, and then the corpora are used in training and testing emotion recognition models, the accuracy results improve considerably compared with those of emotion recognition models trained and tested by the original corpora. In the best case, the accuracy improves by 37.47 percents. Also, the proposed methods can considerably improve the reliability of agreement among annotators.","This paper proposes three methods for removing or filtering out ambiguous utterances: the filtering based on the first label preference and majority vote, the filtering based on full consensus, and the filtering based on the first label preference and full consensus. We investigate two corpora, which are Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database (IEMOCAP) and Emotional Tagged Corpus on Lakorn (EMOLA). The first corpus is an English language corpus whereas the second one is a Thai language corpus, and both are annotated by six annotators. We primarily study only four emotions, which are anger, happiness, neutral, and sadness. The experimental results show that, once the emotionally ambiguous utterances are removed from a corpus by the proposed methods, and then the corpora are used in training and testing emotion recognition models, the accuracy results improve considerably compared with those of emotion recognition models trained and tested by the original corpora.

Second, unlike inside-outside algorithm based methods, the acquired grammars are not restricted to Chomsly normalform CFGs and less computational cost for training is required.

2528,Thanaruk Theeramunkong, ,"This paper proposes a new method for learning a context-sensitive conditional probability context-free grammar from an unlabeled bracketed corpus based on clustering analysis and describes a natural language parsing model which uses a probability-based scoring function of the grammar to rank parses of a sentence. By grouping brackets in a corpus into a number of similar bracket groups based on their local contextual information, the corpus is automatically labeled with some nonterminal labels, and consequently a grammar with conditional probabilities is acquired. The statistical parsing model provides a framework for finding the most likely parse of a sentence based on these conditional probabilities. Experiments using Wall Street Journal data show that our approach achieves a relatively high accuracy: 88% recall, 72% precision and 0.7 crossing brackets per sentence for sentences shorter than 10 words, and 71% recall, 51% precision and 3.4 crossing brackets for sentences between 10-19 words. This result supports the assumption that local contextual statistics obtained from an unlabeled bracketed corpus are effective for learning a useful grammar and parsing.","This paper proposes a new method for learning a context-sensitive conditional probability context-free grammar from an unlabeled bracketed corpus based on clustering analysis and describes a natural language parsing model which uses a probability-based scoring function of the grammar to rank parses of a sentence.

The proposed method employs artificial neural network to predict traffic on the links with sparse FCD available. The experimental result demonstrates that our method is capable of producing comparable results with existing methods.",A FCD–based Method for Traffic Congestion Detection in low-proximity data environment

Electrospinning of PS solutions was carried out at various applied voltages and tip‐to‐collector distances The production rate of the obtained PS nanofibers was quantified in terms of electrospinnability. We found that the chance for the resulting PS solution to be spinnable is greater for solvents with high dipole moment and low viscosity.

The effects of flow rates (4,000 l/h, 9,000 l/h and 12,000 l/h) were studied at a controlled hot water temperature (80 C) at a fixed experimental period of 2 hours. It was found that, at higher flow rate, the pressure drop was lower with thinner calculated scale layer thickness ranging from
1.42 cm to 0.53 cm and 0.17 cm, respectively. This might be because the protein ß-Lactoglobulin could not attach and spread out easily on the heat exchanger surface at high flow rates. As a result, the efficiency of the heat exchanger was increased, leading to lower energy consumption and longer production time. In addition, this research proposed to use a theoretical model to link between the calculated scale layer thickness and the reduction of heat transfer.

2592,"Cattaleeya Pattamaprom, Karoon Jiamjitsiripong", ,"Due to its low air permeability, butyl rubber (IIR) has been used in various applications including footballs, tire inner liners and insulators of air-conditioned tubes, etc [1]. Nevertheless, as the cost of butyl rubber is considerably high compared to natural rubber (NR), NR is potentially blended with IIR to reduce cost. However, since the cure time of IIR is inconsistent with NR, inhomogeneous curing may cause phase separation inside these blends. In this regard, bromobutyl rubber (BIIR) has replaced IIR for the blends with NR [2]. The outstanding characteristics of NR are its high toughness and resilience; nevertheless, the drawback of NR is that it can be easily degraded by heat and ozone. Moreover, it also possessed low oil resistance and high gas permeability, which is undesirable in some gas storage applications. Generally, the presence of methyl groups serves to reduce the gas permeability of polymers. Butyl rubber is more saturated and has more methyl groups than natural rubber causing it to be twenty times less permeable to air [3]. Therefore, by blending NR with BIIR, some modifications should be incorporated to improve the properties of the NR/BIIR blends.

Good choices of reinforcing fillers for abrasion resistance and gas barrier purpose are those with platelet structures.

A mapping procedure is developed that links the empirical parameter K of the double reptation model to the molecular parameter τ e of the dual constraint model, thereby allowing the parameter K to be related to molecular characteristics such as the monomeric friction coefficient ζ. Once K (or τ e ) are determined from data for monodisperse polymers, the double reptation model predicts that for fixed weight-average molecular weight M w , the zero-shear viscosity η 0 increases slightly with increasing polydispersity M w /M n for log normal distributions, while for the dual constraint model η 0 is almost independent of M w /M n . Experimental data for polystyrenes show no increase (or even a slight decrease) in η 0 with increasing M w /M n at fixed M w , indicating a deficiency in the double reptation model.

2609,"Bart Kosko, Sanya Mitaim",101,Stochastic resonance (SR) occurs when noise improves a system performance measure such as a spectral signal-to-noise ratio or a cross-correlation measure. All SR studies have assumed that the forcing noise has finite variance. Most have further assumed that the noise is Gaussian. We show that SR still occurs for the more general case of impulsive or infinite-variance noise. The SR effect fades as the noise grows more impulsive. We study this fading effect on the family of symmetric α-stable bell curves that includes the Gaussian bell curve as a special case. These bell curves have thicker tails as the parameter α falls from 2 (the Gaussian case) to 1 (the Cauchy case) to even lower values. Thicker tails create more frequent and more violent noise impulses. The main feedback and feedforward models in the SR literature show this fading SR effect for periodic forcing signals when we plot either the signal-to-noise …,2001/10/22,Robust stochastic resonance: Signal detection and adaptation in impulsive noise

Input-output mutual information measures the performance of such threshold systems that use subthreshold signals. The SR result holds for all possible noise probability density functions with finite variance. The only constraint is that the noise mean must fall outside a “forbidden” threshold-related interval that the user can control—a new theorem shows that this condition is also necessary. A corollary and simulations show that the SR effect occurs for right-sided beta and Weibull noise as well. These SR results further hold for the entire uncountably infinite class of alpha-stable probability density functions.

2611,"Sanya Mitaim, Bart Kosko",35,This paper presents a new method to create and tune joint fuzzy sets. Multidimensional fuzzy sets define the if-part fuzzy sets of rules in feedforward fuzzy function approximators. These joint set functions do not factor into a product of scalar fuzzy sets (such as triangles or bell curves) and so they do not ignore the correlation structure among the input components. The joint set functions transform a scalar distance measure that preserves the correlation structure. Supervised learning tunes the metrical joint set functions and tunes the scalar set functions that make up factorable joint set functions. Factorable joint set functions tend to collapse to spikes in high dimensions. This holds for all joint set functions that combine factors with product or minimum or other t-norms.

The impacts of sawtooth oscillations on impurity transport and accumulation in ITER are investigated using 1.5 D BALDUR integrated predictive modeling code. The impurity species considered are a combination of helium and beryllium. For each simulations, a linear combination of MMM95 anomalous transport and NCLASS neoclassical transport is used to describe both thermal and particles transports. Sawtooth oscillations are described using the Porcelli sawtooth triggering model and a modified Kadomtsev magnetic reconnection model. Self-consistent simulations for standard type ELMy H-mode and steady state ITER scenarios are carried out for duration of 1 hour with and without the effects of sawtooth oscillations. It is found that, for the standard ITER scenario, helium and beryllium densities tend to accumulate inside the plasma. Both helium and beryllium densities quickly rise and reach steady-state values. It is also found that sawtooth oscillations have a strong impact on suppression of the impurity accumulation.

Regarding triangularity dependence, the simulations based on both MMM95 and Mixed B/gB models show a decrease in the nuclear fusion power production as the plasma becomes more triangulated. Furthermore, the simulations using MMM95 consistently yield higher plasma performance (approximately by a factor of 3) than those using Mixed B/gB. In addition, when MMM95 is used, it appears that the ion temperature gradient (ITG) and trapped electron modes (TEM) are the dominant modes. When the Mixed B/gB is used, it appears that the Bohm contribution is the most dominant term.","Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology, Bangkok, Thailand 2 Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat U., Pathumthani, Thailand 3 Department of Physics …"

In these simulations, anomalous core transport is described by either using Mixed B/gB model or using MMM95 model. It is found that the temperatures obtain from both simulations are in the range of experiment results. When the ECRH is applied, ion and electron thermal transport increase. Consequently, ion and electron temperature and plasma stored energy increase.

2858,"A Siriwitpreecha, T Onjun, S Suwanna, R Picha, N Poolyarat", ,"In the operation of a tokamak, the divertor plates and other plasma facing component (PFC) materials get some interaction with hot plasma by ion backscattering, chemical and physical sputtering processes, which yield impurities into the plasma. In ITER, the critical level of impurity concentration is 4.0% for carbon, 0.1% for ion and 0.008% for tungsten with respect to the electron density [1]. The presence of these impurities can contribute to radiation loses and plasma fuel dilutions, which can decrease the performance of a tokamak. The impurity accumulation occurs when the radial density profile of an impurity evolves a stronger peaking than that of the main plasma ion, which is usually observed in the central part of the plasma, namely inside a normalized radius r/a< 0.5 [2]. The impurity transport in the SOL region and the impurity penetration to the core is one of the key issues in the edge plasma physics [3]. In recent work, Leekhaphan P. et al.[4] had shown that the impurity accumulation in ITER standard type I ELMy H-mode depends sensitively on boundary conditions and the level of impurity transport. In this work, we investigate boundary conditions for deuterium density and impurity carbon density. Two models are used to simulate the deuterium and carbon density profiles-, like those in [5]. The first is called a static boundary density model, where the deuterium and carbon density values at the top of pedestal are kept fixed.

The Tore Supra plasma discharges with LFS pellet injection (discharges 45072-45085 and 45716-45734) are simulated. In these discharges, the toroidal magnetic field varies from 1.9 to 3.8 tesla. Consecutively, 4 to 6 pellets per discharge are applied. The experimental pellet deposition and penetration can be measured by using CCD camera and interferometer. The CRONOS code with pellet module is used to simulate these experimental results. In these simulations, the core transport is calculated using a combination of the GLF23 anomalous core transport model and the NLCASS neoclassical transport model. The pellet ablation in the hot plasma is described using NGPS pellet ablation model. It is found that the simulation results of pellet penetration agree well with experimental data obtained from the CCD camera. In addition, the result shows that the toroidal magnetic field does not have strong influence on pellet penetration.","In this work, we aim to study the effect of magnetic field on pellet penetration in Tore Supra Tokamak using CRONOS integrated predictive modeling code.

Toroidal velocity is one of the terms used in calculation of the ωExB flow shear. There have been much study of momentum and velocity transport in poloidal direction but not much has been done in the toroidal direction. Recently, the pinch velocity is being investigated because it is believed to affect toroidal rotation. In general, the toroidal velocity can be expected to be a function of plasma parameters including plasma density, current and/or torque.
