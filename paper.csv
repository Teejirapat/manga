Instead of using commercial activated carbon, researchers have worked on inexpensive materials, such as chitosan, zeolites, and other adsorbents, which have high adsorption capacity and are locally available. The results of their removal performance are compared to that of activated carbon and are presented in this study. It is evident from our literature survey of about 100 papers that low-cost adsorbents have demonstrated outstanding removal capabilities for certain metal ions as compared to activated carbon. Adsorbents that stand out for high adsorption capacities are chitosan (815, 273, 250 mg/g of Hg2+, Cr6+, and Cd2+, respectively), zeolites (175 and 137 mg/g of Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively), waste slurry (1030, 560, 540 mg/g of Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cr6+, respectively …",2003/2/28,Low-cost adsorbents for heavy metals uptake from contaminated water: a review

6,"Sandhya Babel, Satoshi Takizawa",169,"This study was carried out to investigate the membrane fouling phenomena due to algal deposition and to understand the nature of the cake deposited on the membrane while treating the algae-laden water by membrane filtration. To accomplish this, batch experiments in dead end mode were carried out using Chlorella algae to investigate the effect of feed concentration and transmembrane pressure (TMP) on cake resistance using cellulose ester and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. It was found that algae can cause significant fouling of both the cellulose ester and PVDF membranes. Fouling due to algae is quite complex because these cells release extracellular organic matter (EOM) which significantly increases the resistance.

14,"S Babel, TA Kurniawan",68,"Contamination of groundwater due to toxic heavy metals, such as As and Hg, is of international concern. In this paper, the technical feasibility of some technologies to treat metalcontaminated groundwater is reviewed. All data presented are quoted from the original sources. It is conclusively evident from the literature survey that low cost technology, like adsorption, can demonstrate excellent metal removal capabilities comparable to reverse osmosis. Due to chemical modification, adsorption using inexpensive materials, such as coconut husk carbon, can remove As (III) with metal adsorption capacity of 159 mg/g. This high adsorption capacity suggests that adsorption treatment technique is capable of reducing a residual arsenic concentration to 10 µg/l, which is the maximum discharge limit set by the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). In spite of the availability of various technologies to treat metal-contaminated groundwater, the suitability of a selected technology for such a purpose depends on the initial metal concentration, the residual metal concentration required, the removal performance on heavy metal compared to other technologies, and the overall treatment cost.",2005/12/1,Various treatment technologies to remove arsenic and mercury from contaminated groundwater: an overview

By doping with Sr, a Sr-rich shell was formed over a Sr-poor core. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy revealed the simultaneous occupation of the K sites and Ta sites by Sr cations. A concentration gradient of Sr cations occupying the Ta sites was suggested to be produced after doping with Sr. The concentration gradient of Sr cations simultaneously induced an energy gradient of the conduction band edge bottom. Hence, photoexcited electrons are separated, which are driven away to the bulk by the energy gradient, from the complementary holes present on the surface. The higher the Sr cation concentration, the higher the energy gradient produced.

The effect of reaction temperature on the yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is studied. Conventional transesterification is also performed for comparison. FAME production is also carried out with new cooking oil (NCO). The results show that a reaction temperature of 80 C is optimum for FAME production in the presence of either KOH/CS or CaO-ES. The produced biodiesel properties satisfy the criteria according to ASTM D6751. Acid catalysed esterification of WCO before transesterification leads to higher production of FAMEs due to the reduction of free fatty acids (FFAs). However, conventional transesterification using WCO without esterification yields lower FAMEs. Although the microwave heating decreases the reaction time, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in FAMEs. The production of FAMEs depends on not only the type of transesterification process, but also the type of feedstock.

The result shows that PS NPs remained substantially stable in low ionic strength (NaCl: 1-200 mM or CaCl2: 0.1-5 mM), whereas significant aggregation occurred in high ionic strength (NaCl: 400 mM or CaCl2: 10 mM). In addition, under the same ionic strength conditions, the particles remained more stable in Na2SO4 solution rather than in NaCl. The addition of natural organic matter had no significant effect on the aggregation of PS NPs at 150 mM NaCl, 0.1-1 mM CaCl2, or 1/3-50/3 mM Na2SO4. The aggregation of PS NPs was boosted at 5 mM CaCl2, while it was inhibited at 200 mM NaCl or 200/3-400/3 mM Na2SO4.

The highest content was found in the body suit in which silver wires were visible. The concentration was in the same range when compare to synthetic nanosilver fabric. When confirmed the result with SEM-EDX analysis, two samples were found to have silver on the surface of fibers. The diameter is approximately around 5.0 µm (500 nm), which is larger than the nanosize (1-100 nm). In three samples, titanium was found on fibers and surface of the samples and also found in eight ash samples. The leaching results from nano-Ag fabrics with deionized water were found in range of 146 to 229 µg/L. Type of liquid coming in contact with materials containing nanosilver, may have impact on amount of nanosilver leached and this should be investigated further. The concentration range in the product found from this study showed the potential risk of nanosilver releasing during use phase or disposal phase, especially in Thailand, where solid waste is mainly disposed on the landfill.

An alteration in canal’s geography due to the development of industrial estate coupled with the pollutant discharges by upstream community has hindered the use of canal water for the downstream community who depends on the canal most. This research project is carried out to mobilize stakeholder’s participation on environmental issues of Bang Pa canal. It involves capacity building of the community in water quality conservation through water quality monitoring and biological assessment using macroinvertebrates. For this, 60 volunteers from four sub-districts were actively involved. The integrated results of water quality and macroinvertebrates analysis show that the upstream water quality of the Bang-Pa canal is better as depicted by physico-chemical and biological parameters (water quality index). As the canal passes through the community, the quality deteriorates as the polluted water flows into the canal through alternative paths. The activities of the project have been integrated with the ongoing environmental efforts of the villagers on the conservation of the canal to maximize the effect. The involvement of local administration was rated as satisfactory by the community towards the issues of the canal.

The granular CSBAC was made up of coconut shell, an abundantly available agricultural waste from the local coconut industry in Thailand. Chemical treatments of CSBAC and zeolite with HNO3 and NaCl, respectively, were also conducted to improve their removal capabilities. The results of their removal performances on Cr were evaluated and statistically compared. It was conclusively evident that the chemically treated adsorbents (CSBAC and zeolite) demonstrated significantly better removal capabilities for Cr6+(CSBAC: 15.47, zeolite: 3.23 mg/g) than asreceived adsorbents (CSBAC: 4.72, zeolite: 1.79 mg/g), respectively.
