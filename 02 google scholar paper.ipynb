      "2003/2/28\n",
      "In this article, the technical feasibility of various low-cost adsorbents for heavy metal removal from contaminated water has been reviewed. Instead of using commercial activated carbon, researchers have worked on inexpensive materials, such as chitosan, zeolites, and other adsorbents, which have high adsorption capacity and are locally available. The results of their removal performance are compared to that of activated carbon and are presented in this study. It is evident from our literature survey of about 100 papers that low-cost adsorbents have demonstrated outstanding removal capabilities for certain metal ions as compared to activated carbon. Adsorbents that stand out for high adsorption capacities are chitosan (815, 273, 250 mg/g of Hg2+, Cr6+, and Cd2+, respectively), zeolites (175 and 137 mg/g of Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively), waste slurry (1030, 560, 540 mg/g of Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cr6+, respectively …\n",

A particular focus is given to chemical precipitation, coagulation–flocculation, flotation, ion exchange and membrane filtration. Their advantages and limitations in application are evaluated. Their operating conditions such as pH, dose required, initial metal concentration and treatment performance are presented. About 124 published studies (1980–2006) are reviewed. It is evident from the survey that ion exchange and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied and widely applied for the treatment of metal-contaminated wastewater.

Both granular adsorbents are made up of coconut shell (Cocos nucifera L.), an agricultural waste from local coconut industries. Surface modifications of CSC and CAC with chitosan and/or oxidizing agents, such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively, are also conducted to improve removal performance. The results of their Cr removal performances are statistically compared. It is evident that adsorbents chemically modified with an oxidizing agent demonstrate better Cr(VI) removal capabilities than as-received adsorbents in terms of adsorption rate.

The Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the biosorption equilibrium and isotherm constants were evaluated at different temperatures. Equilibrium data fitted very well to the Freundlich model in the studied concentration (20–800 mg l−1) and temperature (25–55°C) ranges. The pseudo first- and second-order kinetic models were also applied to the experimental data assuming that the external mas transfer limitations in the system can be neglected and biosorption is chemisorption controlled …\n",

      "In recent years, various methods for heavy metal removal from sewage sludge have been extensively studied in order to minimize the prospective health risks of sludge during land application. In this paper, a comparative review and critical analysis of the application of chemical extraction, bioleaching, electroreclamation, and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), in removing heavy metals from contaminated sludges is presented. Moreover, speciation studies, which can indicate ease of leachability of the different forms of heavy metals in sludge, are also presented. Experimental studies revealed a broad range in metal extraction efficiencies of the different extraction technologies. Acid treatment seemed to effectively remove Cd, attaining as much as 100% removal for some studies, as compared to bioleaching. SFE also gave higher removal efficiency than bioleaching.

      "This study was carried out to investigate the membrane fouling phenomena due to algal deposition and to understand the nature of the cake deposited on the membrane while treating the algae-laden water by membrane filtration. To accomplish this, batch experiments in dead end mode were carried out using Chlorella algae to investigate the effect of feed concentration and transmembrane pressure (TMP) on cake resistance using cellulose ester and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. It was found that algae can cause significant fouling of both the cellulose ester and PVDF membranes. Fouling due to algae is quite complex because these cells release extracellular organic matter (EOM) which significantly increases the resistance. The cake resistance offered by the Chlorella algae was independent of the membrane materials considered; thus the interaction between the membrane material and …\n",

It was found that acid production, enhanced when the digester was operated at neutral pH. VFAs, could be obtained at about 50 g/kg-waste within 14 days when operating at pH 6.5–7.5 compared to 33 g/kg-waste for digester operated at pH 5.0–6.0 for 32 days. The total volatile solid reduction of 42–48% was obtained with a 51–57% volume reduction at neutral pH. The effect of undissociated acids on the activity of acetogenic bacteria was also studied. The inhibitory level of undissociated acids for acidogenesis was found to be about 2300, 650, and 120 mg/L at pH 5, 6, and 7, respectively. The results revealed that at low pH …\n",

      "A seasonal fluctuation pattern was observed in membrane filtration resistance by Chlorella algae cultured in open ponds in the tropical environment. In order to investigate the causes of this phenomenon, Chlorella was cultivated under controlled conditions and the cake resistance was measured by batch filtration in dead-end mode. The filtration resistance was found to be a function of environmental conditions. Algae could grow favourably and offered low specific cake resistance (Rcs) on the order of 1011 m/g for the culture temperature from 28°C to 35°C. The algal growth was inhibited and the specific cake resistance increased to the order of 1012 m/g below or above this optimum temperature range. Strong solar radiation, coupled with high temperatures, also inhibited the growth of algae and resulted in higher specific cake resistance.

      "The possibility of using volcanic ash soils (VAS) or Andisols as a low-cost and natural adsorbent is investigated in this study for the removal of Cr (VI) from synthetic wastewater. Andisols can be used as adsorbent because they are characterized by the presence of non-crystalline secondary minerals such as allophane and imogolite that show variable charge characteristics and have the ability to retain cations and anions. The adsorption of Cr on to two VAS from Mt. Isarog and Mandalagan (B-Horizon), Philippines, was carried out at ambient temperature using batch adsorption studies. The effects of different parameters such as amount of adsorbent, contact time, initial Cr concentration and pH of the solution were investigated.

      "Various treatment technologies to remove arsenic and mercury from contaminated groundwater: an overview\n",
      "S Babel, TA Kurniawan\n",
      "2005/12/1\n",
      "Contamination of groundwater due to toxic heavy metals, such as As and Hg, is of international concern. In this paper, the technical feasibility of some technologies to treat metalcontaminated groundwater is reviewed. All data presented are quoted from the original sources. It is conclusively evident from the literature survey that low cost technology, like adsorption, can demonstrate excellent metal removal capabilities comparable to reverse osmosis. Due to chemical modification, adsorption using inexpensive materials, such as coconut husk carbon, can remove As (III) with metal adsorption capacity of 159 mg/g. This high adsorption capacity suggests that adsorption treatment technique is capable of reducing a residual arsenic concentration to 10 µg/l, which is the maximum discharge limit set by the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). In spite of the availability of various technologies to treat metal-contaminated groundwater, the suitability of a selected technology for such a purpose depends on the initial metal concentration, the residual metal concentration required, the removal performance on heavy metal compared to other technologies, and the overall treatment cost.\n",

      "In this study, an inexpensive, environmental benign acid catalyst is prepared using coconut meal residue (CMR) and employed for biodiesel production from waste palm oil (WPO). The total acid density of the catalyst is found to be 3.8 mmolg−1. The catalyst shows a unique amorphous structure with 1.33 m2 g−1 of surface area and 0.31 cm3 g−1 of mean pore volume. Successful activation is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The highest biodiesel yield of 92.7% was obtained from WPO in an open reflux system using the catalyst. Results show that biodiesel yield increases with increasing methanol:oil (molar ratio) and reaction time up to an optimum value. It is found that the catalyst can be reused for at least four cycles for >80% biodiesel yield. Fuel properties of the produced biodiesel meet international biodiesel standards.\n",

The results of their removal performances in as-received forms are compared to each other. It was evident that between the two low-cost adsorbents, CSC has a higher chromium removal capability (2.18 mg/g) than zeolite (1.79 mg/g), while CAC demonstrated an outstanding adsorption capacity (4.72 mg/g). In fact, the adsorption capacity of CSC at 5 mg/l of chromium concentration is comparable (4.30 mg/g) to that of CAC (4.72 mg/g) at 20 mg/l. It is important to note that the adsorption capacities of adsorbents varied, depending on the characteristics of the individual adsorbent and the initial concentration of chromium.\n",
